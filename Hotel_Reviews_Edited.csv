29/09/2022, Ireland , The bar area and lobby are very pleasant but the prices at the bar are eye wateringly expensive e g 19 for a margarita The mini bar prices even more so 15 for cashew nuts 7 for a mineral water There are however plenty of shops and bars nearby , This was my second trip to the Pullman It s a lovely hotel perfectly located in the Montparnasse area and very convenient to the metro and train stations The room was very clean and comfortable with great views of the city There are some nice touches like a robe and slippers Staff are very helpful and friendly It was good value also Breakfast was included and was decent cold meats cheese fruit cereals croissants and various breads ,9.6

28/09/2022, United Kingdom , It was a well worn hotel with little to offer other than its position which is excellent The staff were friendly but the whole hotel is well below the standards set by the big chains such as travel lodge let alone any Mayfair top grade hotels I couldn t recommend it to anyone I know , Friendly staff,4.6

28/09/2022, United Kingdom ,No Negative, The staff were great but the hotel itself is dated and desperately in need of renovation For example when I got to the room it was chilly and rather than just turn up the thermostat I was advised to go to the wardrobe to get the portable heater out and plug that in The room was very compact and beige ,6.3
28/09/2022, France , Room was claustrophobic a cramped sleeping quarter 40 cm on the left of the bed 70 cm at the foot My husband and I had to make sure not to move at the same time in the room then a sort of corridor with a sofa and Bathroom WC View on a concrete wall In fact the whole hotel was too small too cramped too dark One could call it a bed and breakfast without a breakfast room Corridor to stuffy and hot lift miniscule Not 186 euros worth I am afraid , Location is very good The room was silent at night ,5.8

27/09/2022, United Kingdom , This is not a glossy business hotel It is rather old fashioned and a little worn The interior needs a touch of paint in places but I found the former charming and the latter acceptable given the overall level of service and the cost , The hotel is situated in a quiet backwater just off Park Lane Piccadilly in an area more interesting than either My single room was compact but great value Clean quiet with a good bathroom It is excellent value for central London and if like me you are a non business traveller and need a convenient base for an event at one of the larger hotels or clubs without paying a silly amount it s perfect Good generous breakfast ,7.9

07/05/2022, United Arab Emirates , The rooms are too small Its basically a 3 star motel Initially when we arrived we were informed of the non availabilty of double beds inspite of the fact that we SPECIFICALLY booked for double beds on the upper floors ahead of time Imagine sleeping with a friend in a small bed after 6 hours of travelling on the train we begged of course and they relented afterwards The bedframes were moving and we had a view of a ledge littered with cigarette butts of the first floor roof The hallway smells musty Breakfast of 70 euros is not worth it Better take your breakfast someplace else , It s close proximity to the Gard De Lyon Station The fact that they close the main doors of the hotel after midnight The area of Gard De Lyon at midnight is full of arab and african migrants and some are really creepy or very furtive so this extra security measure is a plus 98 of the staff are very friendly ,5

24/02/2022, New Zealand , Communication was complicating as they kept emailing and asking for my credit card details when booking Com already had them We went out for the day and expected our room to be cleaned by the time we got back 4 30pm and it wasn t Not good when you have a very tired child wanting to sleep while they clean your room The breakfast was limited and always crowded I don t like giving negative feedback but we did expect more from a Hilton Hotel and the price we paid , Location Was perfect place to stay for us as close to the tours we went on and easy access to transport with Victoria station and tube right over the road ,7.5

02/02/2022, United Kingdom , Our room itself although quite small despite paying extra for a spacious Privilege Room was nice It was however badly let down by the bathroom The worst of the problems were a shower that wouldn t stay in position I had to fix it with a business card and a supposedly clean towel that was put in our room with stains and what appeared to be chewing gum stuck to it With these major flaws in mind you start to notice smaller things that maybe wouldn t bother you otherwise The bathroom looked a bit rundown in general with 2 spotlights loose in the roof and the taps for the shower broken away from the wall at one side though still functional Given that the rest of the hotel was nice I m a bit puzzled that Mercure are satisfied with poor quality bathrooms in a hotel they class as 4 star Noise inside the hotel was also an issue room doors would slam shut hard and people moving around in the hallway could be clearly heard in the room , Great location just 5 minutes walk from Earl s Court Tube Station with Earl s Court itself just a little further Very convenient for getting around on the district or Picadilly lines short tube trips for Paddington Station and the Leicester Square area Lot s of bars and restaurants along Earl s Court Road and surrounding area Breakfast was excellent though the breakfast room is a little small so could be quite busy The bedroom was quite well protected from noise outside the hotel though noisy inside see negatives and the curtains were pretty effective at keeping out morning sunlight too Staff were all great with us ,6.7

18/01/2022, Spain , The shower wasn t my favorite It didn t have any glass doors it was just a tiled space in the corner of the bathroom with a wrap around shower curtain No matter how careful we always managed to get water everywhere making the floor a mess and slippery Our room also had an unpleasant odor to it not sure if its just because the hotel is a very old building or it there had been previous guests that smoked , We were lucky to have one of the few rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower which was wonderful I liked that the windows were double paned and we could open them up for some fresh air and an even better view of the Eiffel Tower The location of this hotel centrally located for any traveler who is wanting to see the main and best highlights of Paris It s right next to the Louvre Museum and the Jardin des Tuileries and other prominent museums The bus and metro lines are very close with quick access to the other sites to see The concierge was helpful the night before we left to get us an early taxi to the airport The bar and terrace looked beautiful but we did not visit them ,10

19/11/2021, Monaco , We have been coming to the st ermins hotel for 13 years well before it became a Marriott and lost most of its unique character all references to its long history as an important building in Westminster at the history of its name the redesign by an undoubtedly modern designer who designs uncomfortable tables and chairs throughout the hotel but this is not the best we checked in at 11 30 in the morning and the receptionist not English with a bad command of the language told us we would have to wait note Was travelling with a lady of 95 years so we had lunch and returned to the reception only to find out they had reallocated the ground floor rooms with easy acces And a walk in shower which had been expressly reserved 6 months prior to someone else the manager then attempted to offer another hotel in London we declined so after another hours wait they gave us two very uncomfortable and tiny box rooms at the back of the hotel not acceptable so I complained and had to wait a further hour and they found us two other rooms adjacent with a shower but not on the grond floor for the 95 year old lady not appropriate much too much walking as it was as far away from the lifts as it could have been we got into these rooms at 6 pm Madame was by this time exhausted the manager was completely useless and simply said he was sorry the service throughout the stay was dreadful with staff who barely speak English and management completely incompetent we received no apology from the management in a note or letter to Madame the standards at this hotel have sunken a dreadful stay we will not be repeating , It s location,5.4

28/10/2021, Qatar , I think I can write a big essay here Service does not match with its name brand I dont usually use hard words but service everywhere in the hotel was pathetic Reception told us that we get 2 bottles of water per person per day but the guy at room service would only give 2 bottles 1 plain and 1 sparkling It s kind of compulsory to take sparkling so you cannot get two normal water and he made a big fuss out of it either you take this or i am going breakfast was another struggle i ordered omelette which took 20 mins and then came a wrong one Then i requested to get hot water for tea as we had to wait a long time for the omelette then came the right omelette but 20 mins to bring hot water so omelette got cold and they were not even apologetic Staff behavior was such that at times it was close to being rude Room service was ultra slow they forget things to bring with breakfast and then would take long time to bring which spoils your mood for breakfast meal the cleaning people would call 10 times for room make up even when you tell them that we will let the reception know and even after informing they entered our room for cleaning while we were there I have a long list and can go on mainly related to service It is a big hotel and you as one customer do not mean much to them I guess As I said only because of Nima we managed to have good time at the hotel , The only good thing worth mentioning or praising at Pullman Paris was the gentleman at the information desk named Nima He is an amazing individual excellent in dealing with requests and has answers to almost everything He helped us in everything during our stay we would have struggled big time if he was not there A big thank you sir for making our stay really good otherwise we would be regretting for paying so much just to stay in one okay sized room The facility is modern style so the room and bed was good the bathroom however needs some attention as the shower was broken and door lock did not work View from the room was good Location is really good you can walk around and there are so many options for shopping food etc Family friendly place ,5.4

13/10/2021, United Kingdom , The first room we were given was very badly layed out Having had a busy day we wanted to spend a quiet evening in our room and watch the TV However due to the TV being positioned in a recess we could not see the full screen plus the view was further obstructed by one of the bed posts In fact the only place one could actually view the full screen of the tv was by sitting on the desk which was clearly not acceptable After speaking to reception we were offered an alternative room which was better however the bed was so high my wife had to use a chair to get in it I am almost 6 foot tall and I even found it a struggle to get into bed There was also a dreadfully disturbing repeated sound of running water which appeared to be coming from pipes or drains within wall cavities I contacted the duty manager at 10 30pm and she came to the room and agreed the noise was dreadful The overall experience was certainly not what I would have expected considering the room rate I was paying On checkout we were given a 10 discount off our bill but as our stay was intended to be a treat for my wife s birthday the experience fell well short of our expectations , All the staff tried to be helpful and the location is good ,5.4

06/08/2021, United States of America , The fact we had to leave our hotel and Paris , Our room was magnificent a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower Paris Eye and of course all the beauty of Paris The staff were far exceeding even our expectations of a first class hotel They went out of their way to make us feel at home advising us to be sure to try the bar across from the hotel entrance on the corner And their restaurant is filled with staff that is at once unobtrusive yet attentive The service and food must be experienced to understand that without a doubt not a dinner but an epicurean delight of ambience and great food Across the street on the corner is a wonderful Bar Bistro that has scrumptious salads and main dishes that were less expensive than I would have expected for the quantity and quality of the food A must do when staying at the hotel Another tip grab the two day hop on hop off bus pass for around 40 euros and explore all of Paris The pass is far cheaper than trying to get a taxi in some areas My wife loved the shopping so guys wear comfy walking shoes and enjoy the people of Paris ,10

04/08/2021, Belgium , I booked couple of weeks before travelling and I ended up in a microscopic room that was probably no more than 7 m2 Quite frankly for 200 GPB per night the room I got was ridiculous and I say it having been in London many times for business in this category of hotel It was only there for one night but I was annoyed nonetheless as I purposely avoided other less expensive hotels exactly not to end up sleeping in a cage I made my point to the reception at check out and they kindly offered to do better next time which is of course nice but maybe it would have been more appropriate to warn me upon arrival and maybe offer a discount at the point I was asked to pay at check in since I can t possibly believe the one I had was a standard room for single occupancy , Very nice breakfast nice geographical location the hotel was proper and clean,6.3

02/07/2021, United Kingdom , Terrible beds ridiculously soft saggy old mattresses with springs that I could feel digging into me Also shorter than a regular bed would have been terrible for anyone taller than me I am 5 ft 5 and my feet were on the end of it In addition there was what I can only describe as a super thermal winter duvet in summer making it so incredibly hot that I could not sleep under it even with the noisy air con set to very cold I literally have never known a duvet like it It belongs in the arctic There were no sheets either so it was either super hot duvet or nothing The bed and duvet meant that I had an absolutely horrific night of barely any sleep Room was also unbelievably tiny and the corridors etc are the same giving it a bit of a b and B feel Considering we paid 180 it was not good at all and breakfast would have added another 30 but we decided against it Some staff were unfriendly but then perhaps I wasn t in the best mood to judge them kindly after such a horrible sleepless night No mini bar or fridge either I would not stay there again , Very clean room nice bathroom some staff were OK ,5

02/07/2021, United Kingdom , Although the buffet breakfast was good the cooked food was lukewarm at best maybe the temperature of the heaters on the unit needs to be cranked up The hotel had free wifi which is excellent but you need to get a new password every 24 hours which is a bit of a hassle On the day of our check out the TV mysteriously stopped working and wouldn t show any channels and the fire alarm went off in our room only I think these are fairly underhand tactics to get you out of your room before the 10am checkout time which is too early in my opinion , The hotel is really close to Earls Court and West Brompton stations and there s lots of shops and restaurants near by if needed The staff were friendly and attentive ,9.6

01/07/2021, United States of America , First single room I had was exceptionally small and hard for me to move around in so I did upgrade to a larger room as I was staying 6 nights Was not impressed with the Steak and Lobster restaurant for dinner It seemed odd that that was all you could order at dinner time when the room service menu was much more extensive Coffee was frequently cold at breakfast as they seem to make a number of pots in advance and not to order Ask for a pot of hot coffee and the staff will accommodate One slow elevator for both guests and service personnel is not enough and was quite frustrating at times , Location is hard to beat for access to shopping and the underground Bed was very comfortable and the room very clean and attractive ,8.3

29/06/2021, Bangladesh , I booked a single deluxe room When I entered the room I was very shocked by the size of the room which was like a shoe box There was no closets in the room and the single bed which they said was a queen size bed which took up the entire room and there was hardly any room to move around The bathroom was very tiny and hard to move around For the rates they are charging like 160 pounds 200 pounds per night the rooms are very much disappointing and later I had to pay additional money to upgrade to a bigger room I will not stay in this hotel anymore a the rooms are tiny and they charge way too much for the rooms It was more like a 2 3 star hotel and Radisson brand needs to upgrade the room sizes in this hotel if they want to maintain their standard Very much disappointing , The location was very good in the heart of central London near to shopping sightseeing restaurants underground etc The breakfast was good in the restaurant ,4

08/06/2021, United Kingdom , Approaching the hotel from Pigalle Metro Station you see a large sign saying Villa Royale atop a building and a few doors at the bottom of that building directly below the sign As i went into those doors i am told that this is not the hotel just a cafe The actual entrance to the hotel is around the corner Opening the door to the hotel which is a VERY heavy door there is no immediate sign of reception just some chairs and paintings I had no idea where to go until a worker walked past and took me to the reception a tiny thing not bigger than a schooldesk I checked in fine but i was rather surprised that every single time i leave the hotel i have to give the key back to the reception staff and they will give it back to me upon my return After coming back from a days activities i go to reception to get my key back from a person i had not met before and all i had to do was say the room number and he gave me the key to the room This begs the question of could anyone saunter into that hotel and ask for any room key and they d get it There were literally no checks and this made me a tiny bit worried about my belongings when i was out and about No complaints about the room but if you want to be extra picky it was a small gap between the bed and the wardrobe so for people who are slightly larger it may prove a problem Also one of the wardrobe doors opens less than halfway because of the bed , A rather decent hotel with each room dedicated to a certain type of Artist Desginer most of them French The more expensive rooms get you the more upmarket designers Louis Vuitton Coco Chanel etc The room i stayed in overlooked Pigalle Square and it was quite a nice atmosphere and view from my balcony Pigalle metro station is less than 30 metres from the hotel entrance which is a big plus With pretty good views of Sacre Coeur rooms facing the front of the hotel and a 10 minute walk from Moulin Rouge its not the worst place to be in The rooms are rather nice with decorated carpets plush wallpaper and an ornate bathroom The beds were comfy a touch on the firmer side but still nice A generous amount of storage space for one room with a good 12 hangars in the wardrobe Just round the corner from the hotel is a long road full of sex shops and strip clubs Didn t really bother me that they were there but its worth pointing out that there are a LOT ,7.9

06/06/2021, Australia , Check in was quite poor I modified my booking via Bookings com at least 3 months prior to arrival however the hotel had no record of these changes This is the second time that I have stayed at the Pillar Hotel and the reception staff tried to indicate that the previous booking from 2014 was the same as the 2016 booking which wasn t even in the same name It took far too long for reception to sort out whatever needed to be sorted out at their end before providing the room key Also as with the previous booking we had to ask to change rooms after only a few days The rooms don t appear to be maintained as expected as the bathroom tiles were cracked and the floor moved thus creating a health problem as you could not step out of the shower with bare feet We were offered the room next door which had the same issue although to a lesser extent The room that we moved to did not have a working safe and maintenance was not available until the next day Every morning we had to call reception for amenities whether it be towels toilet paper tissues etc as housekeeping didn t replace these as expected Also every day the shower mat was placed inside the wet shower making it sopping wet and unusable There was no business centre with a computer and printing facility that could be used by guests and the staff were very inquisitive as to why such services were needed which frankly is none of their business They tried to assist in locating an internet cafe but where they sent me did not exist As one of the few decent hotels in the area it would be expected that a corner of the hotel should be converted into a business centre to allow guests to have access to necessary services that cannot be accessed via tablets , There was plenty of parking on site Location is easily accessible via road and public transport ,5.4

19/04/2021, United Kingdom , On our first night we asked the sour faced barman if food was available without speaking he looked at his watch and then threw a couple of menus down on the bar We took them to a seating area and were chatting and looking at the menus I briefly went to the toilet and when I came back my friend told me the barman had taken the menus away I saw a member of staff serving people with big plates of food so enquired to her if food was still available her reply was food finished one minute ago So the attitude of the bar staff and lack of basic communication got our weekend break off to a very poor start We went to bed hungry after travelling all day Is that how a four star hotel operates It was very embarrassing as my friend was visiting from abroad and had been travelling all day yet they allowed East European prostitutes to bring bags of smelly McDonalds into the bar and eat them there without buying any drinks , Check in out staff great breakfast staff also very efficient but due to problem on first night with bar staff we did not use the bar area again during our stay Room fine everything to a decent standard We would have liked a kettle and coffe tea facilities in the room but had to do without which is not great when you want a drink when you first wake However as we were packing our bags to leave at the end of our stay we found these facilities hidden away in a draw Quite frustrating but overall a good hotel Twenty seconds walk to Victoria station but the prostitutes eating McDonalds in the bar is not good for this hotels image so we did not go in the bar again after the first night ,8.3

18/04/2021, United Kingdom , Was not advised I would be receiving an access affordable room under the equalities act This would not be an issue but as I have a L4 and L5 vertebrae bending to the low level wash hand basin was painful More so the drop down support arm beside the toilet bowl was used to support the towels which I found to be very unhygienic , Breakfast staff friendly ,4.6

07/03/2021, United Kingdom , Having seen other reviews it seems that issues I can across do not seem to be actioned Such a toilet roll holder in a very awkward place in the small double handle on window so loose it may of come off which meant i could not lock it securely This meant due to being on the side of extractor fans it was rather noisy so even paying over 100 for a room where you cannot sleep is rather counter productive Two pairs of ear plugs provided but I cannot sleep with them in and fo not expect to wear them I should not have to The doors are heavy and heard people in and out of room all night and could hear the lift go PING all night It would be a great hotel if these things for comfort reasons were addressed as other Mecures have a higher comfort level and you can sleep soundly , The cleaners do an excellent job ,5.8

14/02/2021, Russia , 1 Even though the room was fully prepayed they charged me additional 100 euros at the arrival As it was explained it s in case I use anything additional during my stay and after my departure they will be returned to my bank account Be careful it s 50 euros for person for every night of your stay As of now it s been nearly three weeks and money still not returned to my bank account Personally I am never again staying in another Mercury hotel because of this policy and I honestly am scared to think what can happen if for example additional 500 euros are blocked on my card for more than three weeks you can be left without any money during your trip if you are on budget 2 The staff was very unhelpfull as money was blocked on the card without any normal explanation and even though I was talking before my stay via e mail with the hotel s reception aka do I need to pay anything else the asnwer was only breakfasts if you want them nowhere not on the booking com not on the hotel s website not anywhere is mentioned that they are blocking additional 50 euros for each person for every night of your stay Conclusion if you are a guest from out of France and on a budget trip do not stay here There are other hotels near this train station without any guarantee blockings It s more expensive than you think , 1 It s just few steps away from Gare de Lyon very comfy if you need to get on the train 2 Room very small classical France but comfy and quiet 3 A bit too expensive but wonderful breakfasts,7.5

07/01/2021, United Kingdom , For the night I was there could not fault it as I had no issues arise in my stay there really Only minor point for anyone staying there is they do not have a main full restaurant there so would need to take a five to ten minute walk either way to find food establishments but does serve food like a selection of fresh made sandwiches during the day or a pizza which is their limit but what they did offer did taste nice and was quite fair for the money considering London prices can be , Hotel felt quite quaint and not overcrowded for a city hotel and staff were very friendly professional and efficient at their roles within the hotel made it a hassle free stay for the night They even looked after my bags on the second day when I checked out to go to a exhibition and picked them up on the way through at the end of the day Also as standard they have a mini bar fridge which comes with complimentary soft drinks two bottles of water but has no sensors so you can stock up on cold beverages of your own from round the corner at the local Sainsbury s without fear of being charged when you take a drink out was quite nice to have in a standard room It seemed nothing was to much of an effort for them no matter what you asked for or needed In short with my one nights stay I was impressed with the Mercure as the standard rooms are a normal size affair not to small but not yet massive with a nice bath shower set up and comfortable beds with nice pillows Could not fault the cleanliness through out my stay either ,8.8

25/11/2020, Lebanon , The building was built in the 1880 s and it is well maintained the metro is extremely close however I believe that being an Intercontinental Hotel there is no harm in combining the existing nice old architecture with some modern amenities To be more specific the rooms are spacious but they need some modernisation For example the doors and windows should be changed In the bathroom the shower should be also replaced with some modern mixer taps The water pressure in the shower is very poor the hot cold water mixing isn t functioning properly The vanity unit is poor The toilette is spacious but there are no bidets As for the cabinet inside the room during our stay one of the cabinet doors fell down Luckily my elder son 16 years was opening it and not my younger 5 years old son Anyway we called the reception and they strongly apologised and fixed it we even received an apology letter from the Guest Relations and also a complementary basket of fruits But again it could have been dangerous Anyway as i rated the staff earlier in general they are extremely friendly and very helpful Hence I hope that the management of the hotel takes my constructive remarks into consideration because as I mentioned before the hotel has really a great location and very nice and helpful staff , Great location Great Staff Very Good Breakfast,8.8

24/05/2020, Russia , We were given a room on the basement floor and it was the worst hotel experience in my life The cell phone signal tended to die out a lot in the room I had to constantly go to the ground floor to make phone calls The Wi Fi didn t work 90 percent of the time and when it did work it was only for a minute or two Due to the room being basically underground it was constantly dark and the lamps didn t give sufficient light The constant semi darkness was extremely depressing To be fair there was a window in the room but it overlooked some rubbish bins or something like that in a basement and there were constantly people poking around those bins so we had to keep the curtains closed which again led to the problem of not enough light And the absolutely worst thing is that either the guests or the stuff of the hotel used this corner of the basement as a place for smoking and we constantly had the terrible smell of smoke all over our room My mother having asthma had to double her inhaler usage and I had to take anti allergy pills , Good location amazing choice of breakfast foods AC luxury shower ,5

10/05/2020, Greece , value for money way off Even though it was a great price for the location it was still 230pounds per night And for that amount of money I expect at LEAST not to hear my next door neighbours chatting at 4 oclock at night they were not shouting or arguing but the sound insulation of my room was worse than the one you find at a chicken shed I suppose I expect a bathroom finished to good standard a socket to charge my phone close to bed and working wifi wifi was actually not working for most of the time and when it did it was too slow Bathroom was poorly finished with damaged tiles poorly repaired as well and plastic part of toilet seat partially broken Not what you expect from a hotel with Hilton as part of its name Disappointed with the room I assume it does not reflect the image of the rest of the hotel but I did not get a lot for my 460pound weekend accommodation I have stayed at much better rooms costing 20 of this one, great location ,5

24/01/2019, United States of America , We selected to stay at the Regina for our last four nights after a month stay in France We had high expectations since this is a 5 star hotel but sadly we were extremely disappointed It was a really sad end to an otherwise amazing time in Paris and France When we arrived the room was nice but in a very poor location There was no view and the noise level from the hotel staff was outrageous On one day we counted ten times hotel staff slammed doors outside our room There was constant noise from the hallway from staff and from outside our room with things clanging crashing We might have been near the hotel bar or restaurant It was not acceptable There was no hot water in the shower in our room when we arrived We called the front desk twice to get someone to look at it The night manager checked it and confirmed it was broken We were offered a smaller room on a lower floor in a less desirable location for the same price no less or wait until morning to have it fixed We thought the offer was pretty ridiculous so we opted to have it repaired in the morning We were told someone would arrive between 8am 9am to fix it No one showed up so at 9 30 we called and someone finally showed up at about 10 15 He got it to work but only minimally so We were not offered another room or any discount on our room The water was lukewarm at best with NO water pressure whatsoever The staff were polite but very slow to respond We had to call four times to get towels and when they arrived at our room they did STILL did not have what we requested They constantly entered our room even when the light outside our room was red indicating we wanted privacy and did not want our room serviced When the green light indicating service was wanted no one showed up We had to call to request service We called to complain about the noise and the fact that the shower was still not functioning properly , Location of the hotel Strong WiFi Beautiful hotel,5

21/01/2019, Netherlands , This property is way overpriced for what you get especially the breakfast One of the front desk managers completely darkened our whole stay there She was particularly rude and sarcastic Regarding some travel problems we were having she offered no solution Literally talked back to me Did not even treat me with basic sensitivity nor as a customer whose satisfaction was important She seemed to have no regard for the fact that she herself is a public representative of the Hilton but rather she acted as though she was doing me a favor by just being there even there are 100s of hotels to choose from I will never go back there or recommend this property and I may never choose Hilton again because of Giulya, over all the staff were nice and the property is clean,5

18/01/2019, United Kingdom , The pool was freezing I mean FREEZING my son wouldn t get in and the changing rooms had dirty towels dumped all over them also being right next to the lobby means you have to go to the pool in your shorts and walk past everyone checking in The room staff were friendly but they were very keen to have us out of the rooms by 10 to clean them the car park is not for the faint of heart as it s a tricky ride in and is expensive But after all this the location is awful you walk out to the street where the tramps relieve themselves it stinks and is at the other end of Paris from the majority of the attractions Eiffel tower 7km away for example Yes it s a Novotel but it is pricey for what it is , I liked the rooms they were good the free minibar was a nice touch with a bottle of water and a few small cans of drink the towels were plentiful and the robes a nice touch and the staff were all very helpful and polite ,5.4

11/01/2016, Canada , While we stayed for 5 nights and on the third floor there was no elevator working The bathroom faucets were broken in the bathtub including drain Shower rod kept falling down Shower curtain had orange mildew on it The air conditioning was very loud We paid for a deluxe room and slept in a hard old double bed Poor lighting only lit one side of room No view other than large rooftop ventilation system The pictures posted on your website did not come close to what we experienced This is definitely not a four star hotel by our experience , Nothing,3.8
10/25/2016, Iceland , The rooms are tiny and not suitable for 2 adults plus luggage The bed was comfortable though Regardless of the facilities the staff is not qualified to handle any problems On the day of our arrival the elevator broke down and was broken for the entire stay We were a family of 5 staying in 3 rooms for 5 days all situated on different floors Second third and the fourth You can imagine the stairs we had to climb During the whole day there were construction work going on in the building so it was best to stay out for the whole day Then the reception was moved into a room on the ground floor because of some construction work that was supposed to start after the weekend but hadn t started when we left All that fuss and confusion for nothing All our communication with the reception team was really awkward and they seemed to be in a hurry to do something else I take my hatt off though for the bell boy who had to carry all our luggage up and down the stairs The only thing we got out of them was we are sorry for the inconvenience We were not compensated in any way at all or were invited to move to a lower floor Not even invited to have breakfast for free or something They didn t seem to care at all They even ordered us a cab that was way more expensive than a regular cab and smaller Just go for a London cab with a meter not the ones they call ,No Positive,3.8
10/05/2016, Croatia , The first night when we arrived at the hotel we were given the room 008 The room is in the groundfloo at the back of the building The only window looks at the ventilation shaft 1 m square wide The room does not have proper daily light and the curtains nor the window should not be opened if you do not want to stare at the dark hole of the shaft Next door to the room are lavatories for the staff which were used squiking doors several times during the night The room was tiny I have never been in such an unsuitable space The hotel by renting this room is cheating turistis Such a room should not exist let alone be rented for 130 pound night Disaster I never have been in such a space I can t even called it a room Whan I asked for anothe room the answer was that the hotel was fool and that they will solve the problem in the morning Mercifully next morning we were moved to a room on the first floor with normal daylight and window looking over the park The breakfast room is too small crampled and siuated in the basement The breakfast is poor I would strongly advised anyone not to even start thinking about visiting this hotel ,No Positive,3.8

09/04/2016, United Kingdom , The room was too small there was no space at all The room was extremely hot there was air con but it was broken I asked at reception if they could sort it out and had to go back to remind them They looked at it and brought us a fan There was a window in the room but outside of it were foil pipe insulation so no air came through The experience we had we wouldn t stay there again , The reception area ,3.8
8/28/2016, United Kingdom , incredible small rooms even for London staff not very friendly or helpful no restaurant bar for lunch dinner room service they only serve breakfast very poor water pressure in the shower not very clean but I ve seen worst Definitely not a 4 star hotel you can get much better value for your money in a lot of 3 star hotels in the city, location is pretty good bathrooms are new,3.8

6/29/2016, United Kingdom , Extremely disappointed with my stay Firstly I was rung midmorning of my arrival date to be told I was being relocated to another property then after an hour of phone calls en route whilst on the train to London found I could in fact stay at the hotel despite the maintenance issues that were occurring having had to press for this information firmly and repeatedly I also had to ask for an address and name of the hotel as I could not find it on google worrying to say the least and a little stressful Booking com were not very helpful either I d booked this hotel months ago and of course it would be impossible in London to find an alternative accommodation in the vicinity I required at just under 80 for the night Perviously they have been great On arrival I was put in a room which could have been considered a closet with a window onto an industrial vent The heat was unbearable and after calling down to reception and growing impatient hailing some porters I saw in the hallway still running late to get to the business event purpose of my trip I was moved to another room and due to time restrains had to just agree to it The furniture was in a deplorable state broken and chipped the shower was dirty with orange scum on the grout and limescale on the head the mirror was cracked down the middle but at least this room had a window albeit onto the back of other properties and having to open and close doors of he wardrobe bathroom to navigate to it Later I asked to book a taxi and only on almost arriving at my destination the firm they d used not knowing how to get there I was on the gps on my phone was charged a fare that was 6 more than the going rate for a hackney cab something I thought I was ordering instead of a private firm Apparently this rate had been agreed prior to my departure why they didn t tell me this I have no idea , Staff were as helpful as they could be those I met face to face were very polite accommodating and tried to make the best of all the issues I had during my stay ,3.8

05/11/2016, Russia , Our room was robbed using housekeeping key proved via access logs which hotel managers could not link to any of employees Managers of the hotel did not provide any apologize just were saying that this could not happen Room was robbed at 1pm in the middle of a day hotel staff refused to show who entered exit the hotel around this time and provide informmation what other rooms were accessed using this unknown housekeeping key explaining that this is too hard to do for them Hotel staf was refusing to assist me calling the police and said that this is my problem and i should care about that Summarizing staying in this hotel be prepared that your room could be accessed using unregister housekeeping key and nobody of hotel staff will take responsibility for such poor security,No Positive,3.8
2/28/2016, Ireland , This hotel took a sum of 81 60 from my bank account the night before I was due to stay with them I phoned the morning of my flight to query same and was told there was a hold put on this amount and once I paid on check in this money would be released I was then advised that there were maintenance issues with our room and so we would have to move to the London Premier Kensington Hotel Upon checking in I went to pay the bill in total with a different card only to be told I couldn t A manager eventually came to our assistance and took the total amount from the second card and told me they would ring the bank to release the hold on the 81 on the original account It is four days later and I am yet to receive this money back into my account despite having paid the bill in full on the second card The girl on the front desk called us a complimentary taxi and asked him to bring us to the Park Hotel which he duly did We were checked in there by a staff member and sent to a room in a different building across the road from the hotel This building did not have any access to wifi which was one of the reasons that we booked the Notting Hill Hotel This was very inconvenient for my travel partner and I The water in the shower was cold and when I went to bring this to the attention of a staff member at the Park Hotel I was told we had been checked into the wrong hotel but why was this not communicated to me when I was being checked in there This whole hotel group appears to be in chaos and I would most certainly not recommend any of the hotels which I had dealings with nor would I stay here again Have a look at the Terrible ratings on TripAdvisor and you will see that I am not the first one to have had this experience , I have nothing good to say about this property Take heed ,3.3
2/26/2016, United Kingdom , Do not book this hotel When I arrived at the hotel they told me there were no rooms left and that I would have to stay at another hotel they had arranged I was then told the other hotel was in Euston I explained that we needed to be in Notting Hill as we had planned to meet friends there for the evening and that was the reason for our stay They said if I did not accept the other hotel I was not entitled to a refund After much fuss was made amazingly they manage to find us a room in our original hotel The only problem was that they had not cleaned it and the previous guests dirty socks were laid out next to the bed Still we were refused a refund so we could go to another hotel We did not even sleep in the bed because we thought looking at the sheets they had not been changed although we could not prove this The next morning after 2 hours of arguing our case I got a 25 refund only The booking com representative who called the hotel manager on our behalf said she had never dealt with such poor customer service and was shocked that the manager had no interest in customer satisfaction whatsoever Whist in reception they were redirecting other guests to another hotel so there is no point reading the reviews for this one Once you ve paid your money you re at their mercy I never write reviews on trip advisor etc but this time I feel compelled to make sure no one else books this hotel without knowing what sort of stay could await them Another point breakfast is ridiculously over priced and cold there is nowhere near enough seats for guests as its a tiny basement room , Location ,3.3
2/22/2016, Ireland , I ve never been given such a tiny room you couldn t walk between the bed and the wall without turning sideways There was no space to even put a suitcase flat on the floor The hotel was noisy you could hear machine noises and all the sounds of people coming and going some of the fittings were dirty mould and all of it was in need of serious upgrade This should not be 4 and should not have a high rating on Booking com it is very hard not to be sceptical of the 8 reviews of this hotel , Very pleasant staff That s about it ,3.8
2/18/2016, United Kingdom , Rooms are really small and cramped Club rooms are small so no extra space for the extra money you spend There is no club lounge so you pay extra to have soft drinks whilst sat in the reception The Windows don t open There is a sign that a us of you try to open them they will not return to being in a closed position You do not get the room you request The air conditioning only blows out cold air the heating element doesn t work so your room gets freezing cold You are asked to pay a pre authorisation amount to which on arrival you are told you will receive it straight back this is rubbish They have reserved two separate amounts of my money one of which they didn t inform me of to which haven t been refunded back to me causing my bank to be overdrawn Not onlyhos but they have charged me again for my stay so theoretically I have paid twice Now I am complaining they are trying to say that it takes 3 5 working days to get my money released back to me even though they said it would be straight away Absolutely terrible experience and can guarantee I will never stay in this hotel or its sister hotels if I return to London , Nothing,3.3
11/11/2015, Algeria , we have been very disappointed as we faced a situation that we considered very cheap we have been informed at our arrival that we will be upgraded to a better room than the one we had during our previous visit the next day we complained on the fact that we have been downgraded as the room was for disabled and not practical at all for us also we had no microwave nor fridge like in the room we had previously to apologize the receptionist offered us a breakfast as a complementary for the next day we really appreciated the effort even if we do not eat in the morning we accepted as she was nice to offer the next day 08th November we informed the lady she looked like the supervisor or the head at reception about the offer we had to compensate us then we went for the breakfast the breakfast was already very simple and poor but the chock was that in the restaurant the waitress informed us that she has been requested to allow us only cold food and not hot food I liked the hotel but for this cheap reaction I will never go back this lady has given a very poor and bad image to this hotel PS we don t even eat hot food and usually only take a coffee and croissant so very cheap from a senior in the hotel ,No Positive,3.8
10/25/2015, United Kingdom , On arrival staff asked how I booked the room and seemed disappointed by me using booking com Suggested that I use their site instead and rather insisted on that to an annoying extent Also I felt uncomfortable as I had to give 10 pounds in advance so in case I did any phone calls using the room line the cost would be covered by that amount I really don t understand why I had to do that since I wasn t planning to do any extra costs and if so I could easily pay for that on departure On the top of that the room was ridiculously small so the photos of it are definitely misleading Not to mention that it was on the first floor with a view of the inner walls although I chose a room in the upper floors when I booked There are also other funny stuff going on like for example the toilet seat wasn t even customised on the toilet I would definitely not go back or recommend anyone staying there , Rather fair location,3.3

10/07/2015, Netherlands , We complained about the smoking of other guests despite it being a non smoking hotel The management obviously could not impose this policy as we had to suffer the smoke that came into our room through the aircon vents all throughout our stay Aside from the smoke smell the toilet was on one side of our room junior suite and the sink and shower on the other side It was not a pleasant stay at this hotel Definitely not worth the money we paid , The proximity to st germain,3.8

03/06/2017, United Kingdom , Location is middle of no where Booking com said it was 0 5mi from the shard which is why I booked Turned out to be an hour and half walk or an hour car journey due to traffic The local tube was enough to make anyone not want to travel by tube again Hotel prices are ridiculously expensive for the facilities and location If this was more centre London then fair enough but it isn t and made the whole weekend trip more expensive than it needed to be I can t see why there would be any other reason to stay at this hotel , Clean hotel nothing else ,3.8
08/06/2016, China , The location of the hotel is in a REALLY not safe area though it is 5 minutes walk to a metro station but STRONGLY recommend people not to take the hotel since you can get a way better location and way better hotel with the same price I was staying in park plaza riverbank with EXACTLY same price in the first two nights but way nicer area and location also way better rooms and services Unfortunately they didn t have the other nights available since i booked too late The receptionist who checked us in had the worst attitude ever They locked our luggage and suitcases in the room the second night since our credit card didn t work out and they refused to take our dollars as deposit when we went back to hotel at 11pm No upfront notice via phone number or email we left at the check in form They insisted that we shall either go to the ATM at 11pm at the not safe area or we shall try to make the credit card work An upfront mail about this during the day would be nice VERY UNPLEASANT STAY AND NOT GONNA STAY THERE ANY MORE NOT RECOMMENDING OTHERS EITHER Actually this worst stay ever even got us really bad impression on Holiday Inn brand it was the first time in Holiday Inn and the last time will NOT stay in Holiday Inn brand hotels any more , The receptionists except one particular bad attitude girl are pretty nice ,3.8

09/06/2016, Australia , The reception staff were abrupt and unhelpful Daniel didn t offer help with luggage and didn t provide information how to find room The room has inadequate curtains to block out the light they are four strips of material but the biggest concern was there was a blood stain on the underneath of the bedding that we discovered when turning down the bedding to get in We paid a significant sum to stay in this hotel and when we checked out early and told Daniel the problems we were not offered any recompense The room 522 was also very noisy located near a fire door that constantly banged We left early , The location,3.3

04/12/2016, United Kingdom , The price If i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but 170 is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for 22 it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money Completely mis sold and completely ripped off , Unfortunately i struggled to like anything at a push i would say the check in staff and the guy that fetched me the iron ironing board even though that leaked water all over my clothes and the actual ironing board was wonkey i d have to say these were the only positives ,3.3

11/20/2016, United States of America , The given room was more like a renovated storage room It was a corner room with a weird layout and we needed to walk two steps up from the corridor Room Bed Two beds are placed one feet apart from each other with one bed located just a feet away from the window Because of the jogged wall at the end of the bed that one feet from the window is blocked by the bed With that few steps up going to the room and the duct for air conditioning the ceiling is very low We do not feel comfortable A sofa bed is placed three feet in front of the closet We do not understand the purpose of it we did not request for a sofa bed given that the room is already very cozy That is why we felt like it is a storage room more than anything Area Safety A random fake tourist asked for direction and two fake policemen came to ask for our passport just a block away from the hotel We said No and walked away We have heard this kind of scam for tourists at other countries before We also heard frequent police sirens around the area after eight We just feel unsafe We thought that we were in some bad areas in NYC or Chicago Breakfast The waitress did not replace the tea cup plate and spoon after use and she wiped them with the cloth which was just used to clean the table We were eye rolling , Location One block away from Kilburn Park station and Paddington is just a few stations away ,3.3
11/10/2016, Germany , Receptionist on Tuesday November 8 was very unfriendly I had to wait 10 minutes until she showed up at the reception no more key cards available hotel ran out of key cards room had no window which was not mentioned on booking com when reservation was made online loud traffic noise outside during most of the night and the worst of all heating was not working with nearly zero degrees outside an awful experience ,No Positive,3.8
10/03/2016, United Kingdom , The food was disgusting and came to the table with foreign objects included personal to whoever cooked it which put everyone off their food Staff did not understand English which made communication very difficult Ordering a taxi took 20 minutes to convince reception that we did not want to go to the airport we want to go to the theater overall very bad experience will never stay there again , The rooms were comfortable enough,3.8
9/26/2016, Brazil , Another case of a let down in London This hotel does in my eyes not qualify for 4 stars The lift was broken for 3 days I was on the top floor which shows little care for customer experience The housekeeping was at best basic and rubbish was left on the floor for the 6 nights I stayed Bed comfort is basic and only 2 small pillows are provided Under the sheets I found several pubic hairs There is no hairdryer or iron for clothing The reception was left unattended at night at several occasions which is a security issue as anyone can walk in I also called for a wake up call without anyone answering for at least 10 minutes so this is not an occasional fault The walls are thin and housekeeping make no effort in keeping their business quiet I would pay tops 60 per night for this property,No Positive,3.8
9/15/2016, United Kingdom , Our executive king room was a cramped cave without windows We moved rooms to something a bit larger but which overlooked an alley frequented by drugs transactions and multitudes of rats MULTITUDES We could see the open doorway to the hotel kitchen in this rat infested alley Needless to say room service was no longer an option To cap off our stay the King bed was two rock hard singles pushed together If that didn t keep us awake there was a near constant scratching and squeeking behind the walls and in the ceilings , Mmmm not much Close to the tube station ,3.8
09/09/2016, United Kingdom , No hot water so unable to have a shower Toaster was useless Staff on reception were unhelpful and gave promise that hot water would be available shortly I waited and made myself late for my meeting and yet still no hot water,No Positive,3.3
8/30/2016, United Kingdom , The main issue for me was cleanliness and this led to me complaining in the end However in addition there was no hot water on my first night or the next morning so it was not possible to shower No information was provided either I had to ask reception who said there had been a problem with the boiler no apology or compensation etc The fridge was not working was dirty and when I investigated the plug found the socket hanging from the wall The window couldn t be opened which made the room claustrophobic despite the air con However the final straw was on the last night when I got in bed I noticed there seemed to be a plastic based sheet under the main bedsheet It didn t seem to fit properly and so I investigated and found an under sheet made of plastic towelling top this was badly stained had hair on it and was filthy I took this off and remade the bed At the same time 10 45 pm a fire alarm also went off It did stop after a minute or so but I was concerned and rang reception however the line was dead and I had to ring from my mobile to get through Everything was fine but this was another thing not working also one of the bedside lights I told the receptionist re sheet the next morning and asked a manager to go and look at it before the room was made up I asked that I have a response from the manager when I picked my case up However there was no message for me and as there was a different receptionist I decided to email my complaint So far I have had no reply So pretty poor and i would not recommend this hotel which charged me 96 per night I did not eat there so can t comment on food etc , Location was good for course I attended and near train station ,3.8
7/21/2016, United Kingdom , No room key Not sure sheets were changed Towel was dirty Room was a cubby hole Room was shabby and bed up against wall which in a room that size is claustrophobic Hated whole experience, Almost nothing Common areas were reasonable ,3.8

07/02/2016, United Kingdom , Area is not the nicest Was put in a basement room which was small had a funny smell and no window It was next to the staff room where noise was heard till early hours and started again early morning Staff were apologetic but when you need a nights sleep and there is continuous noise by staff in a stuffy room then the apology isn t really beneficial , This is not a four star hotel,3.8
6/26/2016, Germany , WiFi not working in the room only outside of the room no TV Signal for hours for security reasons window could not be openend should be mentioned on website as some people like to open window while sleeping at least a little bit reception staff just said we are sorry ,No Positive,3.8

9/29/2015, United Kingdom , The room was so pokey it was a joke and for 150 per night it was poor value We were tricked into thinking there were two kingsize beds in the room because of a mirror next to the only bed in the advertising picture Not happy at all , The night receptionist let us eat in the lobby because there was no room in our executive king room ,3.3

4/20/2017, United Kingdom , In the first room the A C didn t work so the room temperature was 28 degrees which made for an uncomfortable night Option to open the window but with the noise of the tube station outside meant it wasn t ideal Plus with work taking place to the exterior of the building with scaffolding covering the entirety of the exterior there was no privacy or safety if the windows were open The staff moved us to a second room where the A C was still not working and just left the windows open The drain was blocked which meant water in the sink and shower just collected and drained extremely slowly Overall all a terrible experience and poor customer service as no form of compensation was offered and no attempt was made by the staff to rectify the problem before the next guests , The interior decor where clean is modern ,3.8
01/09/2016, United States of America , Our room over the street on a busy city square was very noisy into the wee hours of the night the winter wind howled through cracks in the windows The shower controls were too modern in the sense that it was needlessly difficult to figure out how to operate them The deep valley bed offered no comfort The owners hadn t bothered to correct their front signage that incorrectly stated that breakfast was included , The location adjacent to the Shepherd s Bush underground station was convenient ,3.8
09/09/2015, United Kingdom , The hotel room was very cold and noise I could not sleep at all my air conditioning did not work I was keep asking the reception guy but nothing was sorted terrible hotel I will never come back Very disappointed taking in account the room price was quite expensive , Location,3.3
03/06/2017, United Kingdom , The first room was a complimentary upgrade to a triple room which was down in the basement next to a fire exit workers entrance and smoking hiding spot and in the first 5 minutes of being there 4 people came crashing through the fire exit door you know the one that should remain closed I asked if we could be moved and the only room available was opposite the elevator and hotel entrance That s right you here the door open then 30seconds later ping going up this room also had blood on the walls Half the lights did not work and the curtain rail was broken letting a bright beam of light through from the main entrance across the bed where your head lies Now I then checked their website and they are advertising deluxe double rooms for that evening at half the price with a free breakfast The rooms are small that is well documented however if you are 6ft or above like myself good luck fitting in the shower This place is definitely not worth the money Oh and both booking com and the hotel fail to inform you that there building work being carried out from 8am 6pm , Friendly staff Looked after our luggage whilst we went out on the Sunday ,3.8
1/16/2017, United Kingdom , Freezing room and despite frequent requests for staff to turn up heating it remained freezing No extra blankets provided despite requests The original room was so small I would hardly have been able to turn round in it Staff did upgrade me to a larger room on request,No Positive,3.3
01/10/2017, Switzerland , I found bugs on my pillow that could have bitten me They didnt even give me free breakfast or an upgrade or anything they just moved me into another room On top of that I was taking a shower and then the water would not go from boiling hot to normal I had to call the reception and my hair and everything was wet and they had to come up and fix it for half an hour The staff was not even helpful when I had to move the rooms the person just helped us a little but it was is moving our things It was just horrible thank God we were out most of the time , The only thing that was okay was the fact that it was well centered but other than that nothing ,3.3
01/06/2017, Greece , I booked a single room it was tiny for a client of mine that was not very fluent in English they tried to charge breakfast that I had already paid for and also tried to change 200 for phone calls that actually were 60 I had to go personally to the reception and clarify the situation On the guest book the rates for calls was not mentioned for rest of Europe only for certain European countries with an average 1 5 per minute however they claimed it was 3 per minute for Europe while at their book Australia is 2 5 and USA is much less ,No Positive,3.8
12/19/2016, United Kingdom , The rooms were tiny the so called deluxe double room is the size of a tiny single room the bed touched three walls the room was very dark broken wall paper single blazed windows no sound proof at all you can hear the noise from streets outside as well as the TV from next room The staff were not friendly they have us a tiny single room despite the fact we paid for deluxe double room It s a total rip off and we ll never go back again The breakfast was very salty , The only good thing about it is its location ,3.8
12/10/2016, Finland , Had a very depressing dark room in the ground floor The hotel is very basic and breakfast was standard The price is too high compared to the quality , Location good ,3.3
11/27/2016, Oman , Very small rooms Ive booked 10 Delux Double Rooms On check in I realised it is not even sufficient for a single person Beds were very small and no space at all I suggest the hotel to seriously look into this I will never book this hotel once again definitely I seriously doubt on the ability of the hotel to get repeated customers , The hotel was clean ,3.8
11/13/2016, Austria , We have reserved a Deluxe Double Room however the room had only a bed with a size of 190 cm x 120 cm which rates as single according to international standards We couldn t even fit two pillows on it next to each other and the room was so tiny that there wasn t enough space between the bed and any of the walls to fit our normal sized luggage The staff advised us to leave our luggage at the reception however there was not even a cupboard in the room where we could put our clothes only a small rack for the coats There was just enough space between the bathroom and the bed to open its door but once it was open the only way to enter it was through the bed This room was much smaller than you expect at any hostel at a price of an expensive 4 star hotel There were also hairs on the bed and in the shower and also one of the towels had brown spots After some extremely frustrating and heated debates with the very unprofessional and arrogant staff the manager the manager of the manager and the manager of the manager of the manager we got 25 discount for that night breakfasts but for the quality it was still way overpriced From the next day we could move to another room which was much bigger than the first one but the quality was still not high Overall our stay was a nightmare so I would not recommend this hotel to anybody ,No Positive,3.3
11/11/2016, Australia , I was assigned the room on the ground floor opposite to the reception which is different and so much smaller from the luxury single room advertised on the website I could hear all the conversation of the staff members at reception all night The window facing the street does not block the noise either On top of that the bed sheet was dirty I would really not be going back , Bathroom facilities were new ,3.3
10/24/2016, Canada , Absolutely ZERO customer service No help with bags Rooms are small and the housekeeping staff did the minimal amount of work that needed to happen Tiny elevator that can have you waiting up to 10 minutes just to grab a space Usually I am not too picky but so many things were off with this place don t even bother And it is not cheap , Location was the only good thing about this venue Close to Paddington Train Tube 5 minute walk The breakfast is ok ,3.3
7/20/2017, United Kingdom , When I arrived at 1130pm I was told I had been booked into their sister hotel and when I complained they then gave me a room in the hotel but someone had been smoking in it so I had no choice but to complain I was the Told they would order me a taxi to the sister hotel so I waited for five minutes but then I was offered a room just off the lobby which was fine although noisy because of its proximity to the lobby , Close to station,3.8
6/21/2017, United Kingdom , There was construction going on all around the hotel when I arrived The staff felt like they didn t really acknowledge me at all when I arrived and were far too busy in conversation with each other The room itself stank of dampness and smoke and the corridors we literally taped up with water running down the walls Overall a very poor experience will not be returning , The accommodation was very handy for getting to the train station in the morning ,3.8
06/01/2017, United Kingdom , THE ROOM IS INCREDIBLY SMALL THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FOOT OF THE BED AND THE WALL IS APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES AND IF YOU WANT TO REACH THE WINDOW OR USE THE TELEPHONE WITHOUT SCRAMBLING OVER THE BED YOU HAVE TO SQUEEZE THROUGH THIS NARROW PASSAGE I HAD ONLY A HOLDALL AND WAS ABLE TO DEPOSIT THIS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED NARROW SPACE THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITH A LARGE SUITCASE AND I AM AT A LOSS AS TO WHERE ONE COULD DEPOSIT A LARGE SUITCASE LET ALONE MORE THAN ONE LARGE SUIITCASE EXCEPT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR WHICH WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE At 156 I consider that the room was EXTREMELY overpriced , The only things I can say in its favour is that it is reasonably near Paddington station and it was quiet,3.8

02/01/2017, United Kingdom , Do not stay here unless you want to know what sleeping in a coffin is like with really unhelpful hotel management The hotel was in a unfinished state when we arrived with unfinished paint work and dust sheets and with notices to watch your clothes for wet paint There were no signs to help you allocate your room so we ended up going down a wrong corridor I don t recall seeing any fire exit signs or emergency lighting to help you find the way back out either which I thought was actually illegal They appear to be in a rush to take as much money as possible regardless of standard health and safety requirements to their guests The Deluxe double room we were given was basically a padded coffin It was so small that it was impossible to close the door when my husband and I entered the room due to us being in the way There were no windows to this coffin and the only access to the bed was an opening of about 60cm so unlucky for you if you re the one unfortunate to be sleeping furthest away We both felt instantly claustrophobic We told reception it was way too small and that a room with windows was at least the very minimum one would expect for a expensive deluxe We were offered an identical room of the same microscopic size next to this one which was still being cleaned but with 1 window The housemaid showed us another room that she said was free but we needed to check with reception which was a small but normal room by normal I mean you could actually get to the bed We told reception the second room they offered it was still too small for us They refused to offer us the bigger room and basically blamed us for not looking at the pictures of their hotel prior to booking which I had and they were nothing like the room we were given , Nothing ,3.3

07/01/2017, United Kingdom , When we entered our room just by the lifts we noticed that there were scuff marks around chips out of furniture paint etc but nothing too bad We also noticed that the coffee was plain nescafe very cheap instant coffee and whilst I am a coffee snob would have thought that as a four star hotel they would be inclined to provide something of a bit higher quality We had asked for an outside room and were warned the window was obscured to protect residents in the street behinds privacy so although an outside window no actual view Nothing so far to really complain about We went out in the evening to a concert arriving back about 12 30 We both had a shower and pulled the bed sheets back to go to bed now about 1 am As we pulled the sheets back the top stuck to the bottom and there was chewing gum on the sheets We called reception and despite explaining the problem they sent a night worker up with a single sheet He went away and came back and changed the sheets Now about 1 30 we waited in our bathrobes for him to change the sheets a very uncomfortable embarrassing experience But it was done and now very tired we went to bed The room has an obscured window between the bathroom and the bedroom So this means in the daytime you can see each others outline in each room but in the night if you need to use the bathroom and turn the light on you wake the person sleeping We were also woken by people outside the room waiting for the lift When it came to checkout I was expecting some form of apology or compensation for the chewing gum on the bedsheets on the first night This was not offered and we had to explain what the problems had been We asked for a refund for the first night that we stayed and the receptionist said she was unable to offer this but would wipe the bar bill one cup of tea one cup of coffee and one croissant to compensate us This was completely unacceptable to use , We booked this hotel as we used to live in the area and were very interested to see what they had done with the building The location is excellent and we decided to pay a bit more money for a four star hotel to treat ourselves to a nice weekend in London It started off well reception staff were courteous and we were able to access our room earlier than official check in The communal areas of the building were attractive and nicely laid out ,3.8

6/21/2016, United Kingdom , The staff was unhelpful and careless We arrived at the hotel just before midnight We booked the hotel because we went to a concert nearby and thought that it would be easier to stay close to work than drive back home We arrived hungry wet it was raining a lot and tired While my partner went to look for a car parking as the hotel didn t have any car parking space left I checked in and went to the room I arrived at the bedroom and realised that they gave us a disable room which wasn t so bad but not attractive Before I heading to a shower I ordered some food pizza and a salad which was around 12 05am and the person who took our order mentioned that the food would be with us in 25 35 minutes After ordering the dinner I went to have a shower and for my disappointment and frustration the water wasn t warm enough and the shower was weak and the thermostat was broken I finish my shower and was still feeling cold and annoyed as I expected to have a warm and relaxing shower before go to bed So I asked the reception if they could move us to another room where the shower worked so at least my partner could have a warm shower So after 5 8 minutes the manager arrived in the room to check if he could fix the shower as they didn t want to give us another room After 25min or so waiting they decided to move us as they couldn t fix the shower When we were moving to the new room we asked the manager if the kitchen was aware of the change of rooms and his answers was yes We waited and waited for the food and nothing I called the reception to complain and check where the food was a few times the food arrived 1 15am and cold By that time we received the food we were annoyed and tired so we called reception again and told them that the food was cold nothing was done by the hotel manager so we ended up not eating the cold pizza and the salad never arrived they said they didn t have any salad left , The hotel has a lot of potential but they need to train their people The location is great but bad very bad customer service ,3.8

12/15/2016, United Kingdom , not changing the hotel 9 mths after we had paid for it it is quite obvious that you sold our reservation to the highest bidder sorry I am very displeased the way you behaved, the fact that you changed our hotel to mercer st one day before we were scheduled to arrive despite the fact that we had already paid for the room 9 month s earlier and this cost us 18 for a taxi to the royal Albert Hall whereas with previously booked radisson we would have been able to walk so not very pleased with the radisson blu company at all and will not be using you again Brgds MR Richard Rawlinson,3.8

11/08/2015, Norway , From appearance and service the hotel seems more a medium quality 3 stars hotel than a 4 stars Location is well connected but not a classy area of Paris Apart the sexy shops at the entrance of the surrounding lap dance bars personnel is very pushy in inviting you in The interior of the hotel is oldish for the common areas Internet connection was practically useless and just cause of frustration Complained several times to staff but they were already aware of the connectivity issue and could take no action Outside is very noisy also at late hours In general I would not recommend the hotel since in my previous stays in the city I enjoyed much better comfort and at lower prices ,No Positive,3.3
7/13/2017, United States of America , I felt and hurt and cut my self badly in the bathtub their tubs are poorly designed they have a incline section at both ends and their shower heads are placed at a point where it forces you to step in the inclined area of the tub and as anyone can imagine if you are showering normally you will be using soap and this makes this inclined area very slippery The air conditioning was not working well and when we asked they sent some one to check but the first question was where are you from which basically meant what do you expect this is the Mercure hotel The evening manager did not seemed to enjoy his job always with an attitude , Most of the staff were friendly and attentive ,3.8
07/12/2016, Iceland , The rooms are very small and not comfortable beds When we arrived the girl in the lobby told me that they where only going to charge us for one night But few days after the checkout I was told by Email that it was non refundable Not exeptable , Location good,3.8

5/26/2017, Australia , The hotel room was very small and dingy The bathroom was old the shower barely worked as the water pressure was so bad The bed was old and very uncomfortable It was over priced for what you got The website is misleading in that is says they have a restaurant whereas they really just send you across the road to another hotel , It is in a convenient location to South Kensington tube station however that is the only positive comment I can make ,3.8

08/06/2016, Australia , Everything , This was to be our last nights in London We chose this hotel based on traveller comments and photos We like staying in Kensington area The photos do not resemble the rooms We arrived on one of London s hottest days and expected the air conditioning to be working What we were greeted with was an enormous floor machine with large tubing being fed out a hole in the window It was vastly in efficient and gave little relief from the stuffiness of the room I had booked a double room and was astounded when it turned out that instead of a double bed we had two single beds made up as singles shoved together There was a height difference of around 5cm between the two mattresses The bed I slept in had holes in the sheets there was no fridge no grab rails in the bath shower We spoke to Zita who advised that we send an email to complain There is only one lift in the hotel which is slow and can only accommodate 3 people at a time Despite requests to speak to a manager no one was available till we were walking out the door As a guesture we were offered a refund of one night s accommodation ,3.8

7/27/2017, Australia , Our room had no working air conditioning You could tell as soon as you walked in the room After telling the bellhop and 2 subsequent calls to the front desk the manager trolls up an hour later with a portable air conditioner and apologises that the hotel is full and this the best they can do His attempted humour stating you re lucky it wasn t last week with the hotter weather let s just say that went down a treat buddy The so called portable air conditioning unit stood nearly 2 metres high and a metre wide I asked Where does the hot air get expelled He said that it s all contained in the unit Upon further inspection it s a dehumidifier that you have to pour water into The unit blew out old cigarette smells and as far as the decibel volume wow I was then offered another excuse that the whole 4th floor was out Liar seems the air conditioning was working perfectly in the hallway Now I know things go wrong and apologies aside they offered us nothing in compensation for the problem No room discount no drink no food no zip We even requested a later checkout and had to wait until morning for it to be approved Another problem to watch out for is the toilet in the bathroom It s raised on a step that juts out further than the toilet seat edge Nearly broke my toe early in the morning As far as the location of the hotel take it or leave it Didn t float our boat Mind you the 2 negronis we got in the alley down the road cost us 60AUD One drink was enough , The bar area looked very classy but was empty every time we walked past ,3.8

9/18/2016, South Africa , 1 The first room offered was tiny little bigger than a broom cupboard with a shower in it Not even enough space to open my large suitcase 2 The second room offered below basement level was noisy as it was on street level and the window couldn t close so the sounds were disturbing Trying to work the window left my hands greasy with dark grime Due to the noise I had to move in the early hours of the morning 3 The 3rd room was larger and quiet room 208 I think but had a damaged carpet and water damage near on the ceiling near the window It smelt musty The bathroom ceiling was mouldy above the shower I could not sit on the toilet no leg room Had to sit sideways The telephones did not work for 2 days could not dial out No instructions in the room on how to operate the phone dialing out codes reception number etc The pillows were flat hard rendering them uncomfortable to use The light shines underneath the door at night the gap is too big and needs a strip put at the bottom of the door 4 My own fault I overslept and came 15 min late for breakfast on day 1 Staff were unfriendly and I was clearly a nuisance and inconvenience to them No offer of even a piece of toast butter or jam Overall this hotel does not deserve the appellation of 4 Stars It simple misrepresentation , There is nothing to like about this hotel except for its proximity to the British Museum ,3.8

8/28/2016, United Kingdom , Several points 1 TV facility in the room stopped working after only 30 minutes and having contacted staff I was told there was a fault with the system They didn t know when it would be fixed This meant that my staff for one night wasn t off to a great start as I couldn t even watch the TV to unwind from a long day 2 The light surrounds for the ceiling spotlights seemed to be loose as if ready to fall away 3 The lock barrel spindle on my side of the door appeared to be exposed missing a back plate As if it may have been faulty this didn t do much to reassure me of the lock working room security privacy 4 The mirror on the wall appeared to be cracked I brought all of this to the attention of a staff member who came to the room to check the TV when I first reported this fault I believe this may have been the hotel s general manager I was told all of these points were fine The next morning when I checked out I received a verbal apology from the desk staff only when I specifically reiterated the above points no refund on the bill It s very disappointing to pay around 150 for a night at a apparently upmarket hotel townhouse and not receive the service stay you paid for I did write to the company at their registered address three weeks ago and no reply disgraceful anytime I am in London again I will definitely not stay at any of their hotels , Good location ,3.8

2/27/2017, United Kingdom , The hotel itself was confusing It was apartments and a hotel which wasn t stated when booking and when I arrived it looked a mess from the outside as the apartments at the top looked like it was a dumping ground for furniture There was no clear entrance for parking or the hotel and we were greeted by a woman who was anything but warm After a couple of minutes she became helpful however never cracked a smile or made us feel welcome The bathroom had hair all in the shower which made us not want to use it Our room was nice clean and spacious but our view was tainted by it literally being face to face with the gym window so I had to be careful when walking around getting changed as people on the tredmills could see me very clearly The whole reason I booked the hotel was because of the spa facilities however the hydropool was out of use which we weren t told and so we cancelled our bookings because we wanted to relax in the pool and we re disappointed we weren t told until check in as this would of changed my mind on the hotel We ordered breakfast room service and ordered tea even though it was free in our room because we wanted larger mugs When it arrived we had no cutlery no cups no spoons no toast So I called downstairs to tell reception which took 3 calls because no one answered and they gave me attitude because I asked for cups and cutlery After 15 minutes we received our cutlery and toast etc however the man delivering it really didn t believe me and came into the room without me allowing him even though I was not dressed comfortably for this On check out I had to pay for the breakfast and the tea and it was not worth the money for the hassle I felt stressed leaving which I shouldn t have , The room was nice Spacious The shuttle service to the station was good and the drivers were very friendly ,3.8

8/26/2015, United Kingdom , At the time of booking via booking com I was particularly attracted by 5 rating you have there and hence I was eager to pay a premium given that this was going to be a very special night for me and my wife after a very long and difficult period when I had to be in hospital Upon arrival we were greeted professionally and though we had to queue for reception I found the member of staff working well However we were quite disappointed when we went up to the room where we did not find essentials like toothbrushes or toothpaste which would be a norm even in a 3 hotel Later on we realised there was only an empty box of tissues We wanted to use Internet on TV but the keyboard did not work We reported it to the reception and it took a member of staff over half an hour to come to us and change batteries by which time we did not need the keyboard Later it happened that the bondage I have on my neck leaked and we asked for a firs aid kit plasters and cotton pads These were brought to us 15min later no scissors which we asked to bring and they cam another half an hour later and we were asked to return half empty Asda plaster pack when we finished This again did not look particularly 5 to me We asked for a large bottle of water paid and were said that you don t serve water in large bottles I appreciate you are trying to do your best for environment and that s what appeals to my wife and me too but we could not quite understand why the duvet cover had holes in it and gowns were 50 polyester with belts not matching On the final note the water temperature in shower was very difficult to regulate it was piping hot and cold and you could not predict how it would change next minute so there was a chance of burn PS This feedback was sent to the hotel management with no response received from them , Spacious room large bed large window,3.8

1/26/2016, United Kingdom , When we arrived we where met by a very nice gentleman whom checked us in and told us where our room was and that it was all ready for us to go up early check in our room was right beside a building site when we looked out the window we where staring right into the workmen faces they even gave us a smile and a wave they where that close not appropriate for a mother with a teenage daughter to be facing onto I asked to be moved and they moved us one floor up to the same horrid dirty brown room no bedside lamps dirty carpets old bathroom one word shabby I then complained to Booking Com and was told to let the hotel manager sort something out The only thing I wanted them to do was move us to another hotel so I gave them a chance and we got a nicer room on the 8 floor and yes guess what another building site only this time a generator when all night I tried calling Booking Com back and waited nearly an hour for them to answer but we had a reservation to go to so I had to leave it at that On the Monday we were woken to the sound of the fire alarm at 7 05am then again at 8am to be told it was the toaster in the restaurant causing the problem this happened several times and no staff let us know what was going on I had to phone down and ask the reception myself Having to cue up for breakfast every morning was ridiculous too surely they must know how many guest they have staying in the hotel The whole experience was horrific it was my 1st time taking my daughter away since her dad died and I certainly didn t expect unfriendly unmannerly staff and a very poor standard and quality of hotel I stay in London regularly and have stayed in some beautiful hotels No way is this hotel worth the price Try somewhere else trust me , Location was good for shopping,3.8

6/21/2016, Italy , Found the following issues with a Compact double room Bathroom was shared it was not mentioned in the room title as most other hotels do much clearer but only with a short sentence in the room description easy to overlook also because two photos on the four available in the room description were related to a bathroom although then the room contains none The staff was clearly aware of the possible issue as this is the first thing they reminded me immediately after having charged me with the price of our stay proposing also an expensive upgrade to a room without shared bathroom Bad smell in the room Room with a window on a trafficked road one must choose between fresh air or silence to sleep No kitchnette and no microwave but such facilities now seem to have been removed from the description of that room No refrigerator Tea coffee making facilities the kettle had a so short electric cable that it could not lay on the table or on the floor ridiculous but it was even not working hopefully it was changed with a brand new one but only after having requested it Cutlery and crockery were not present at first We received them only on the third day on four for our whole stay still after having requested them But it was then removed and didn t reappear on the fourth day On the hotel website a toaster ironing facilities and a hair dryer are also supposed to be present in such rooms Not present either A complimentary water bottle on arrival was supposed to be provided we ve never heard of it Free WiFi It was so weak and instable in that room that navigating web pages was really frustrating waiting time and streaming anything audio or video nearly impossible Flat screen TV oriented toward the ceiling which is not exactly the best for a good vision I don t understand how this hotel can be part of the Booking com s preferred property programme ,No Positive,3.3

4/24/2016, United Kingdom , No real welcome or warmth from the staff who all seemed harrassed and overworked Discovering a dirty quilt cover at bedtime was unforgiveable Had to wait for housekeeping to come and change it The bar service was very poor after being ignored for almost 15 minutes had to ask to be served Breakfast service was worse Even in executive dining they use some kind of wipe clean cloth almost like plastic which was so wet when we sat down that we had to use the paper napkins to dry it The breakfast service was extremly slow and the quality was not good Dried up bacon undercooked egg cold beans And tea that was so weak it struggled to crawl out of the pot unaided Not worth the money , The only good aspect is the location near theatres Covent Garden and the Thames Upgraded to an executive room which was a good size but awful view see pic ,3.8

2/23/2016, United Kingdom , The Executive Room was poor and definitely not value for money Our room was inward facing basically it s outlook was other rooms in the square Not what you d expect for the nightly price of 240 The bed was small and there was no choice of pillows they were all hard and did not mould to accommodate your head The bathroom was fairly spacious but looked tired and there was no wow factor to it The staff were pleasant but it felt as if this was more out of contractual obligation rather than any real desire to please Overall we were very disappointed and wouldn t recommend this hotel , The breakfast was good and had a lot of choice ,3.3

09/04/2016, United Kingdom , The staff were rude and the concierge wouldn t give us any information about how to get around London The toilet was broken on arrival and it took three phone calls before anything was done and eventually somebody came up at 11 30pm so we had to wait up until they left before we could sleep and we had driven for 8 hours On the second day we got back at 3 30pm to get ready for going to the lion king that night however we got back to the room and housekeeping had not been in I called down to say we were in a rush and wanted showers with no clean towels it took them half an hour to get us towels meaning we didn t have time for a shower before we went out for the night The next day when we returned there was a handyman in the bathroom retiling the bathroom he left after using all the toilet roll for god knows what and the bathroom was a mess from the materials he was using to re tile There was only 1 lift working for the whole hotel for the duration of our stay which meant we had to wait for roughly 5 10 mins every time When house keeping did come I asked the staff member for towels and to not bother cleaning the room she said she didn t speak English and came into the room and started cleaning around us The room we were allocated too had boilers air vents outside that were very noisy all night so gave us a disturbed sleep When going for breakfast we put a do not disturb sign on the door as we had money ipads phones lying around and when we came back from breakfast someone was in our room Overall the stay was absolutely horrific and as a Hilton honours member I am so disappointed that I will probably never stay in a Hilton again , Sandra who worked in the bar ,3.8

3/22/2017, Singapore , The double room I booked was not what I expected They checked my wife and I into one which is smaller that most other single rooms in other hotels of the same catergory There was hardly any space to move in and I kept banging into the TV and the furniture and the window which looked out into some place that resembled a construction site It was a struggle just to open our luggage and I nearly fell of the tiny double bed one morning when I awoke The hot water from the shower came at an intermitten pace so I shivered when I showered I wished I could indicate a COMFORT level lower that unsatisfactory I could not check out earlier as I have prepaid The reception staff were nonchalent and confirmed it was a double room when I notified them and werereluctant to assist in changing my room , The doormen and the porter were very helpful It was the only positive point ,3.8

05/09/2017, Australia , The room The first room I walked into smelt like someone had been smoking in there The carpet had stains all over it and the bathroom was basic nothing like the pictures make it look like The wooden TV cabinet and the like had mug stains all over them and were very unappealing The deal breaker for me was the seamen stain on the corner of one of the bed bases I walked down and asked for a refund and to go elsewhere As this was booked through booking com they could not do this They upgraded me to a satisfactory room which still looked outdated The only nice thing was the bathroom in this one My room was also only made up on one of the 3 days I stayed despite leaving a make me up sign on the outside of the door Wouldn t stay again Ever The rating on booking com swayed me to book this place Next time I ll do more research , The location close to underground ,3.3
05/04/2017, United Kingdom , The club room we stayed in was old and in serious need of an upgrade especially the cramped bathroom that didn t have a walk in shower I was told that only the rooms for physically challenged guests had walk in showers By far the poorest club room I ve stayed in any hotel The room service Indian curry was disappointingly small and I couldn t charge it to my room despite them having my credit card There was no reasonable provision of electric sockets to charge our phones and laptops as in modern hotels It took 3 days to get a very short extension socket The Aircon fan was noisy and the TV was strangely hard to turn on The club lounge was small and dingy mainly providing tea and coffee and was unstaffed when we went I was unclear if the staff were interested in the needs of their guests or just unable to help as the hotel was inadequately resourced To cap off the experience when I picked up my luggage from storage in the afternoon I couldn t open my TSA lock and it had to be broken open When paying over 200 per night your stay shouldn t be tolerated but enjoyed When you can finally find a manager they do seem service orientated but not at any staff level below that I would advise more investment training and a change of culture , The restaurant manager Antonio made a good effort to highlight our limited gluten and dairy free options But the restaurant staff seemed under pressure during very busy breakfast times ,3.3
4/22/2017, China , I booked a standard twin room and the hotel does have an offer to upgrade to the Club room either 50 club lounge breakfast or 30 only breakfast I wanted to have a look at the standard room before I can decide if I need the upgrade to Club room and the front desk was telling me they do not have the availability of the standard room and then later she asked the manager on duty 19 4 17 night and the manager said if I go to view the standard room and the offer will be lapsed Of course this is a surprise to me that Millennium Gloucester Road is having this policy and also running out of already booked room Somehow later they show me a standard room now they have the room in the first floor near the road they said this is the last room usually hotel will not let 100 occupancy for emergency purposes where I did not have a good sleep and wake up every hour in the night They have one row of rooms in that area and if you stay in the hotel good luck Bad management not friendly with not objective to make the guest stay feel like home I would recommend Millennium Copthorn Tara instead as the practice in Millennium Gloucester Road is ridiculous , The Asian Restaurant is authentic in food and decorating in traditional Asian style Staff Eva Eric and Paul are friendly and you will feel like you are in Asia and eating the local delicacy Perfect ,3.3

3/22/2017, China , So so so bad experience and memories when I was in the hotel The first night when I arrive in the hotel after a long long journey so so tired but when I want to take a shower before sleep the water was totally cold cold totally cold no hot water Then I call the reception knowing that the system of the whole hotel was wrong Ok I can understand the system broken but why do not inform the clients early The hotel know it before but did not tell the client I have no choose and then very sad and tired without a shower and then I pay cash to the opposite another hotel to rent a room for shower in the first night I arrive in paris alone and midnight And what is more terrible is the second day morning when I told the new reception what happened last night the reception named Jimmy with very bad attitude told me ok we have problem with the system but we have already make it well now you have already the hot water And I said so how about last night You even did not say sorry and I even pay cash to another hotel for a shower in the midnight and Jimmy said so ok what do you want last night is past and past is past You need to pay So show me the prove Oh my god I even do not believe my ear i stand there do not believe what he said I never let the hotel to pay the fees for shower but my god they even did not say sorry in the second day So rude And make me really angry I travelled all over the world and it was my sixth time in paris but the first time to meet so ugly hart and bad rude guy Even the reception of the first night boy was so sorry and said so shamed for no hot water with many polite but the old reception Jimmy are so so so bad polite , Location is ok just this,3.3

02/07/2017, United Kingdom , I booked the hotel as a double room for my partner and I on what was supposed to be our engagement weekend When we arrived we were put in a twin room with two small single beds pushed together There was no attempt to tell us that we weren t in a double room When I went to the reception to inform them that we had been put in a twin room by mistake I was told by the lady at reception that they did not have any double rooms as apparently the toilet was broken in the double room which I was sceptical about When I asked politely if there was anything that could be done she rudely replied that s not my problem and then turned away from me I couldn t believe how rude she was I was stunned Another couple overheard as they went past and told me that they had the exact same experience My suspicions that the hotel lied about the broken toilet were confirmed when I e mailed them and they replied with a different excuse that they had overbooked They added that they would compensate me with a free breakfast This is basically a scam where a hotel makes you pay for a double room knowing that they do not have one they have squeezed two uncomfortable single beds together in the hope that they will get away with it They do not care remotely about your comfort so please do not anticipate that they will do anything to make your stay more comfortable I honestly am not a demanding customer in most cicumstances and rarely make any form of complaint but feel it necessary to warn people that even though I can accept that this hotel s rooms are small not well ventilated and a little uncomfortable but they do not provide rooms to the specificity they claim and are incredibly rude with little to no customer service There are vastly better options all around Paris Do not trust this hotel as more reviews become available at this relatively new hotel you will discover that this is far from a legitimate and respectable four star hotel , Being able to leave this review so others dont make the same mistake that I did ,3.8

6/19/2016, Canada , Our stay at the Fitzrovia was a frustrating one We booked a double room and initially the toilet did not work We called down and the staff instructed us how to fix it and later that evening the toilet was completely broken The next morning we were woken up to construction with no heads up about it We contacted the front desk in the morning regarding the toilet and construction and kindly asked to change rooms They told us to come down and they would sort it out Once we came down we talked to the reception who told us we wouldn t be able to change rooms until at least an hour later this was after the took our room key for the room we had We explained to them that this was all very incovienent as we had literally woken up and headed right downstairs The reception then asked us if we had nothing else to do until our room was ready Honestly this was insulting we are entitled to stay in our hotel room all day if we wanted to We asked about breakfast and the lady told us we could pay 18 We sat in the lobby where we asked for a glass of water which did not come until over an hour later our room was ready The room we changed into was pretty much the same thing We emailed the manager of the hotel regarding this whole ordeal as the service was truly horrible We felt unappreciated unwelcomed and uncomfortable something that should not happen at a four star hotel The hotel manager called our room and then proceeded to apologise and said how she notices we were interested in the breakfast I am actually appalled I did not send an email to get a free breakfast but to ensure this service does not happen to any other guest Very insulting The hotel itself is fine but the service is questionable Will not be coming back , I would like to start off with saying that I had booked with the Fitrovia because I was recommend it and had taken note that is was a four star hotel I had booked a horrible hotel earlier that day and could not even bare to stay so decided to spoil myself with something more luxurious the Fitzrovia ,4.2
5/24/2016, United Kingdom , We had a triple room booked We were given a fold out bed which was not fit for purpose it was a small fold out bed which was not long enough to accommodate an average height person and once you laid on it your bottom nearly touched the floor I would not accept this at a bed and breakfast never mind a four star hotel it took me an hour and 50 minutes to sort this out which made me miss an event I was due to attend early afternoon I am still chasing them up as I requested a reduction in room rate however they said they needed to speak to booking com on Monday so I would have to pay full rate and they would then consider a refund after speaking to yourselves I asked that the manager call me on Monday to discuss the awful experience and they did not call me I had to call them and they said they are still reviewing and don t know when they can come back to me I insisted I be given a date by which they call me back so they agreed to end of day Wednesday 25th In addition to the bed the room was very tired broken handles on bedside cabinet and stained wall lights as well as air conditioning vents in the ceiling caked with dust I would urge you to inspect this property as it really does not come up to standard It was not stated in the booking com website that the third bed may be a pull out camp bed which is what they are now claiming as of yesterday however when I complained on arrival they said that they were fully booked and that was all they could offer The communal corridors are over heated and feel like a sauna , location ,4.6

1/25/2017, United Kingdom , Worst stay in my five years of business travel Hotel was booked and paid for by my company for business purposes Upon arrival to the hotel I was told I could not check in without the same card that paid for the room but as this was done via my organisation I did not have that card on my person The booking was in my name however and I offered my passport driving licence and alternative credit cards all of which were refused as an alternative I also had a printed document with authorisation from my company for the card use yet the receptionist still demanded to see the card itself before deciding to accuse me of identity theft because I did not have the card This debacle lasted for about half an hour before the receptionist eventually said that my company could send over a faxed copy of the card and a filled out copy of his specific credit card authorisation form With a business booking it is extremely common not to have the card used to pay for the room and usually proof of authorisation which I had or an alternative card which I had is accepted instead In my five years of travelling for business I have never experienced such a rude and accusatory service and after 200 miles of driving to get there it was not at all what I wanted to be greeted with Unfortunately the story does not end there I was eventually allowed up to my room on the proviso that my company would be faxing through the information in the next hour only to then get trapped in the very small lift for several minutes before finally making it to the top floor This was not the only thing that did not appear to be functioning correctly as when I arrived in the room the window was wide open it was the middle of a frosty day in January and upon trying to close the window I realised why it was open it was broken as the latch was hanging off ,No Positive,2.5

05/12/2017, United Kingdom , I had seen the propertys availability on Booking and since I have had positive experiences in spa hotels I was looking forward to it Unlike most 4 hotels there was no real welcome Eventually a young woman asked me what I wanted I said to make a reservation for two nights Without consulting any kind of file she announced nous sommes complete I looked back at the page I had opened where the hotels availability was still plain to see At that moment I should have left already the hotel had displayed poor customer service Eternal optimist I booked it on line and cheerily announced that I had done so Rather than apologizing or offering me a coffee while they put the situation to rights they turned away from me and fumbled with their computers After a while a shabby room was ready No charm rather bare soulless room I thought never mind I ll go and relax in the spa only to hear that the hammam was out of order again with scarcely an apology so all that was available was a chlorine filled swimming pool I must admit they did carry my case to my room but when I left obviously struggling towards them to make check out and claim back the 50euros they suspiciously demanded from me as guarantee there was no offer to help me with my luggage not when there was no longer the possibility of more money they drop the customer I told a man that i was disappointed and he announced mechanically that he was sincerely sorry and blamed it all on the young woman who had dealt with it rather than offering any kind of compensation or making a personal gesture to show that the customer is valuable to them Maybe they could have offered me breakfast which they were selling for 19euros I had glanced at the breakfast and like everything else it looked shoddy and rather vulgar The only nice thing was the little courtyard And maybe its proximity to the louvre , Leaving,4.2
2/24/2017, Saudi Arabia , Paper cups in a 4star hotel is a little cheap 1 English speaking Chanel on the TV Half of the lights in the room didn t work The door to the room required the strength of Charles Atlas to close it and charging guests 5 to place 2 proper cups in the room was a taste of things to come just to put the cherry on the cake the pool was not available and only disclosed once the payment was taken Bring a chest of money if you wish to use the Spa facilities , The location was spot on Staff pleasant ,4.2

01/12/2016, Greece , Where to start really We made a mistake and requested a smoking room which initially they requested 25 pounds more per day When I refused they said they found a room for us When we got inside I was shocked by the size of it The bed was covering everything and if you would try and watch TV from the bed the wall was standing in your way Bed was broken and it was impossible to sleep I have never seen such a bad quality of bed in my life The bathroom was a disaster as water was not very hot in the shower and the pressure of the shower was let s say not enough to take a shower Mini bar in terms of water was emptied during the first day I gave them a call to fill it up which they did but after that day it was never filled again Overall a very old hotel I think in terms of the room that I saw and what annoyed me was that our friends got a completely different room than ours I know that the manager will come and apologize for it but at the end of the day I won t get a compensation for this bad experience so I have stayed to several Radisson s but this is the worst I think in terms of quality , Location Location Hotel is next to everything like Oxford Street Bond Street etc ,3.8

12/19/2016, United Kingdom , Having stayed here a couple of times before I was beyond disappointed this time around The location is ideal and there is parking and leisure facilities However upon check in we were given the keys to someone else s room Thankfully no one was in the room when we opened the door We then went back to reception and were given a new room There were stains all over the carpet of the new room Only 3 TV channels worked The extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work The seals on the windows were broken so the condensation meant you couldn t even see the spectacular views of the city which is factored into the room price We weren t offered any hot drinks at breakfast on both mornings of our stay We had to try and find a waiter who would respond or made the mistake of making eye contact with us otherwise they were all doing their best to ignore us and try to get on with what they were doing Eventually when we did get someone s attention they brought a fabulous latte and a cold flask of hot water for a cup of tea with no milk We then had to find a jug of milk ourselves as the waiters yet again disappeared It might have been quicker to go milk a cow We resorted to taking one from another table The changing rooms in the leisure faculties left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness I walked into the changing room with my two year old daughter to be met with a mound of dirty used towels I would have estimated perhaps 80 or so My daughter was more than thrilled at the sight of towel mountain but I on the other hand wasn t The humidity and stench wasn t a good combination Further upon getting into the pool the floor of it appeared to have sand all over it Free foot exfoliation I would expect that at a beach resort but not an indoor pool All in all not the best experience at a Hilton by far and I ve stayed in many worldwide Very disappointed ,No Positive,2.9

07/06/2016, Sweden , The hotel is very old there are different buildings and we were located in the Tower building which I can only assume was the oldest of them all The room smelled awful and the bathroom was even worse It was rusty and had this really bad smell in it The beds were not comfortable and there was only one working power outlet in the room There are No lights in the bedroom except for the nightstand lights so it was annoying having to always open those especially during the day since our windows didn t bring In a lot of light because we had the Hilton building blocking any light that could come in The air conditioning was also very ancient the room could either be freezing or just too hot They definitively need to renovate and upgrade all the rooms found in the tower building WIfi I have stayed at many hotels in my life seldom I find a hotel that charges its customers for wifi Especially in a 4 5 star hotel And Especially in 2016 What a huge inconvenience When you pay 150euros per night one would expect wifi to be free Oh and there is an additional charge for breakfast Everything was an extra charge I think Hilton can do a lot more when it comes to their customers having a nice stay at ther hotel I was talking about how horrible the rooms were with my friends and some customer staying on the same floor as us were all agreeing with our comments So I know I was not the only one Which leads me to conclude that I will not be staying here ever again and will NOT be recommending this hotel to anyone I know Definitively NOT worth it And I would suggest if others can find a hotel at almost the same price go to that one and stay away from this Hilton hotel , The staff working at the reception were exceptional and very nice Location is next to Paddington Station which is Ok coming from Heathrow airport And next to Edgware tube stop ,4.6

6/16/2017, Malta , Room very small bathroom suitable for a caravan site sink so small you can hardly wash your teeth in drain was clogged with filth and I had to clean it breakfast out of a carton box all in all disaster from start to finish Best to re name hotel into a guest house only paying such room rates for location only nothing else , Nothing much extremely disappointed,3.8
06/02/2017, United States of America , The bathroom was not clean Hair on the toilet and a dirty shower are the welcome we have received The bed had a very old spring mattress and in the room there was a creepy mirror wall covered by a shade Is this supposed to be a four stars hotel The hotel had no breakfast area All they do is providing the customers with a lame breakfast box in the room at a specific time Some cold stuff in it and a coffee or so And don t try to call the reception if you are in need to anticipate it because the answer is no Apparently they are doing renovations so the breakfast area is not available for who knows how long but they don t tell you this detail until you get to the reception to check in So much for the continental breakfast included This is my last stay in a best western , Not much,3.3
5/29/2017, United Kingdom , Service was terrible Asked for extra towel reply got was could not get one until 11pm even after which did not get one The kitchen was closed so breakfast was a box with basically freezed food and nothing in it They should have taken with breakfast option from their booking if so , Location was central,3.8
5/19/2017, Ireland , The whole experience from check in to check out was a disaster We arrived on out business trip to be greeted by construction at the reception area There was no one at the desk to check us in We needed to find one of the cleaning staff after 15 mins to alert reception that customers were had arrived Once the receptionist arrived he was extremely rude We were told that the dining room was closed and breakfast would be delivered to the room the next day Not a major issue there we thought When we mentioned that we were surprised by the level of construction and the effect this had on the overall quality of the hotel experience we were met with an unbelievable answer He informed us that because we had booked through booking com he mentioned it was our prerogative to inform booking com of the construction and not the hotels This is ridiculous We were told to come back later as he could not check us in at 13 00 so grudgingly we left our bags and went to work The rooms were basic enough the morning s breakfast did not arrive We checked out at 8am and three other guests were complaining that breakfast had not arrived in their room either The same arrogant attitude was present from a different member of staff All in all this was a terrible stay from start to finish We were there for only one night but I would advise everyone to seek alternative arrangements in the Kensington area Best Western is a recognised name in the UK hospitality industry this is one of the worst experiences I have had in many years of business travel Staff 0 10 Experience 0 10 Value for money at 198 per room 0 10 Do not stay here , Nothing ,3.3
05/12/2017, United Kingdom , The hotel is currently undergoing renovation Having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind What we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin I have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice How Best Weston had the nerve to charge for this I ll never know I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and I most certainly won t be staying there again, Nothing The pictures on the website did not reflect the actual hotel,2.9
05/07/2017, United Kingdom , The bedroom was extremely small The bathroom whilst clean with good quality fittings was tiny The radiator made access to the sink difficult I could not shave over the sink as the mirror was above the toilet The hotel is undergoing major building work as a result no restaurant We booked expecting continental breakfast We were informed on arrival that we would be provided with a breakfast box This arrived but contained food of poor quality I also had to walk through the building works to get a coffee I think that we should have been advised of the limited facilities at time of booking ,No Positive,4.6

12/11/2016, United Kingdom , This is a very very shabby hotel The carpets were threadbare and a definite trip hazard especially in the main lobby reception area and on the stairs There are very small trip steps in the corridors that actually caused me to fall many times The last time I injured my hand and asked to make an entry in the accident book What accident book I was asked that says it all Health and safety need to take a close look at this hotel for hazards Also the bathrooms were very small if you were over 80kg you would not get in the bathroom , The breakfast was very good Plenty to eat and plenty of choice ,4.2
12/06/2016, United Kingdom , Very inflexible with our booking On booking com website I added what I was looking for in the search bar stating a room for 2 adults and one 9 year old child it offered the rooms available at this hotel and having given the criteria I assumed the search would ONLY reveal rooms which were suitable for me thinking it was suitable else why is it on the list given my criteria I clicked and gave card details Booking was confirmed however I thought I had better check that this double would be suitable and I politely requested a small put up bed for the child as it showed a double room on my confirmation the hotel said no so I politely requested an extra pillow and duvet so we could make up a little bed on floor hotel said no I enquiries why not Health and safety Very Very inflexible booking com appealed for their help with my booking no luck I also spoke to manager she refused and refused to let me cancel as I was within 24 hours of arrival date Booking com were very helpful and couldn t understand the hotel s inflexible approach to my booking which was done in good faith and on the assumption that a little camp bed would be offered NEVER ASSUME Very expensive hotel for what was offered decoration tired in places breakfast very average cheap marmalade and jam mass market stuff coffee and tea from vending machine All in all poor disappointing really as a little more flexibility would ensure a happy customer not so ,No Positive,4.6

12/02/2016, United Kingdom , A hotel that s needs a lot of love and TLC You know things arent good when the TV remote control doesn t work when the water doesn t drain from the sink when a double bed is pushed against one wall so you can get out of bed the other side and when the safe is so safe you can t get to it without being either a magician or a catorcinist And guess what no mention of Thomas the Tank engine railway line running under my room Not good Not good at all , Still wondering ,4.2

10/12/2016, United Kingdom , Inside the hotel is very run down staffed by uninterested clueless Spanish staff with a very poor command of English The dining room is located in the basement and is airless and hot The food on offer for breakfast was appalling Hot food served barely warm with a broken down hot drinks machine Cheapest cereals and sliced bread provided The bedrooms are very spartan and the provision of basic toiletries virtually non existent It seems as though the owners are using this hotel solely as a means to generate revenue without spending a penny on the building or its amenities This is a great shame as it could be an excellent place to stay , The location was excellent for visiting museums and tourist attractions in central London Very close to Queensway Underground station ,4.6

8/24/2016, United Kingdom , The rooms were old and tired as was most of the hotel they were very very small and the air con unit didn t work the hotel was very dated with carpets that looked like they had been there since Henry 8th last visited I honestly can t understand why this hotel is classed as a 4 star as the swimming pool must be tidal with the tide mark that surrounded the pool that come off when rubbed with your finger I ve had warmer ice creams than the what the sauna was I didn t feel at all safe in the lift and expected at any given minute to plummet to my death with the rickety old bone shaker of a lift they have better lift facilities going into a mine shaft this is literally one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in and travelling to London on a regular basis from now on I ll stay in a travel lodge Very poor all round , The breakfast wasn t bad,3.3

07/12/2016, United Kingdom , I specifically chose this hotel because it was close to our meeting the following day and your website stated there was parking which I understood to mean that there was off road parking There wasn t Apart from that major inconvenience I didn t sleep well as the mattress was very hard The room was very small and there was a recurring noise outside the window every 5 or 10 minutes throughout the night which exacerbated my already restless sleep hard mattress Bathroom door kept opening spontaneously and sink was a bit blocked More like 3 than 4 , Apart from scrambled eggs rubbery and chewy breakfast was good Dining room staff were very friendly ,4.2

05/05/2016, Ireland , Carpets filthy room so tiny we couldn t even sneezed no cold water on the tap and shower breakfast really down to basics air conditioner not working in the room I didn t mind about having only Spanish people around us staff customers as I understand but it might be disturbing , Frank the guy from the reception has been fantastic and really accommodating I would credit our stay to his only kindness or else I would have left our daughter found the swimming pool great and pool water was warm ,4.6
4/24/2016, United Kingdom , Breakfast was poor the quality of the produce was low Limited choice not of a high quality The room the floor boards creaked badly I thought I was at at sea in a Old fashioned ship The rooms are in need of real modernisation The shower was poor not stopped at a hotel with a tap mixer shower Poor The hotel had a feel of a contractors hotel more like a hostel than a quality hotel, Not a great deal location was perhaps the only good thing about this hotel,3.3

3/29/2016, United Kingdom , It s very difficult as I don t know where to start 1 all the staff are foreign which is not bad as itself but the problem was they can t speak English at all You expect that the people who work at reception can speak a good English so you can at least check in 2 found staffs are rude from the reception to the kitchen For instance the trainee receptionist was a young guy with glasses can t remember his name but when I asked him to get me his manager he told me that in his wording I m the boss when my manger is not here He was saying this while he was wearing a trainee name badge 3 very old hotel with scary lift 4 the beds are very small and uncomfortable, Good location in central London,3.3

03/03/2016, South Africa , Even though the booking indicated payment only once there the hotel took almost half the booking value a week before without notice When following up they acknowledged that this was not standard procedure and would reverse the money not realising that further losses would occur due to exchange rates very poor and unacceptable The breakfast is basic whilst the hot portion thereof is not up to scratch i e powdered eggs canned mushrooms etc The lifts are scary to say the least and it is concerning that they are operating under those conditions Although there is a sauna it is never hot nor even warm It is a non feature and should perhaps just be removed or closed down Even though the hotel is non smoking there is significant smoking within the hotel and nothing is done about it All in all the hotel is not value for money and should rather be avoided , The room was clean Staff were helpful Indoor pool was good ,4.2
2/16/2016, United Kingdom , I have had problems with this hotel with regard to taking money from my son s bank account without authorisation They took money out twice before he even went and it was a fuss to get it back but on checking out they took a further 88 over and above the sum due On talking to the staff and manager they were extremely unhelpful and told us to contact his bank My son who is from Scotland was left stranded with his girlfriend in London with his bank account wiped out I gave it as a gift and am really angry They still haven t refunded the 88 and I am taking this further I was also horrified to read the latest statements on trip advisor where they are taking unauthorised payments They are a bunch of crooks sorry to say Such a shame the lovely hotel ran by them , the hotel itself was fine It was the staff that let it down ,4.6
02/02/2016, Spain , Solo Traveller TV didn t work whole time I was there Had breakfast option Only one morning out of three did i try to have breakfast and was simply told we are full No attempt to accomodate me They have done pre authorised transactions on my card 4 times So currently in addtion to the bill being paid I currently have another 290 of my funds in my bank account currently reserved by them which I will not get back for another 7 working days,No Positive,4.2

1/22/2016, United Kingdom , The receptionist was extremely helpful but other than that the hotel is more like a 2 star The supposedly superior room was very cramped carpet stained and floorboards creaked non stop The curtains didn t close properly and the view looked onto someone s bedroom The television did not work and as my room adjoined reception I could hear music and people coming and going I returned to the hotel in the evening and there were several make guests drinking outside this gave the impression of a DSS halfway house Certainly for a lone female guest not at all reassuring about safety Breakfast food was cold and generally school dinner like A woeful experience, Receptionist Bea was very helpful,4.6

2/25/2017, United Kingdom , Superior double room was small unremarkable and worst of all was on a significant slant not flat so you felt sea sick and disorientated First night slept poorly due to a constant bright red light and loud humming noise over bed Staff turned it off for the second night which was great but then we recieved a 6 o clock wake up call This was a mistake and was absolutely not requested Above irritating me it was completely unprofessional So therefore I experienced poor sleep on both nights Very very expensive even for central London and nothing to justify it Breakfast extortionate but thankfully endless places to eat within walking distance Staff were pleasant but will never book here again , Staff let us keep our luggage at the hotel post check out Staff were pleasant Location good ,4.6
2/18/2017, United Kingdom , The lack of wifi in our room also please be aware your bathroom floors are very slippery with socks on , Everything very comfortable warm and extremely quiet for London amazing I couldn t get any wifi though which was a bit unfortunate ,2.5
1/16/2017, Belgium , My cabine room was not according to the standards of a 4 stars hotel only 2 miserable coat hangers no wardrobe dirty curtains miserable lighting The staff is not very professional all young people with good will but little experience , The breakfast buffet was just correct,4.2
12/05/2016, United Kingdom , Not good value for money if that was a superior room I would hate to have seen the size of a standard double room For the price we paid breakfast should have been included Have stayed in much better hotels than this paid alot less Really wish that we hadn t bothered with the weekend break not memorable at all , It was clean staff were very pleasant,4.6
9/18/2016, Ireland , The room tilted concave in the centre of the room which meant the bed tilted towards the door If we laid from the side of the bed our heads would be higher than our feet Bedroom was okay old world charm In the room we were provided tea coffee but no bottle waters free or to purchase Bathroom was okay shower was tub shower it was difficult getting in and out because the height of the tub Basic bedside tables and a desk but limited room Hotel had stacked the desk with a load of magazines and a pamphlet to donate to children in Africa The front desk staff were cold and unwelcoming however the room staff was very kind , Attractive area it had a comfortable neighborhood feel Surrounding buildings are other hotels Across the street from a park and just beyond that was a stop for the underground ,3.8
12/22/2015, United Kingdom , On arrival reception smelt odd like old frying fat Arrived at 2 30 to check in and our room was not ready told it would be five minutes it took an additional half an hour Room was large bathroom floor was incredibly slippy and the bathroom was cold Odd shaped hole in the ceiling with fragile looking panels was a little off, Lovely old building close to the tube,4.6

7/16/2017, India , How would you feel if during the summer months in London and nowadays they can get hot you get into your room and the air conditioning doesn t work And it struggles to move the temperature from 26 5 to 26 3 in two hours And it gets all stuffy And the windows don t open And when you speak to the front office or housekeeping they say that yes that is a problem but we can t solve it and then they rub it in by asking if they could do anything else We stayed 4 nights from the 8th to the 12th of July at this hotel at the end of our long travels Our nights inside the hotel room made us believe we ll end our holiday on a new low but then the London weather smiled on us and became cooler for the last couple of days Oh and yes they did move us from one room to another equally stuffy but the temperature did go down to 26 1 They did try to make with free breakfast vouchers for a couple of days but for you enjoy your breakfast you need to have slept well , The location is fantastic There is the touristy huff n puff around you but if you re ok with that then there s little else to complain ,4.2
07/11/2017, United Kingdom ,No Negative, Booked superior rooms with kitchenette x 3 for 4 nights Rooms were so small you had to shuffle around the bed to get in no kitchenette and when complained and told reception this was the room we booked she informed me that this was the biggest room they had Extremely disappointed and will certainly not be booking here ever again ,3.8
07/10/2017, Luxembourg , We booked a rather pricey double room for 2 nights We arrived at the hotel very late only to be given a room where we had open a number of fire doors walk lengthy corridors stairs up and even more stairs down Imagine all this while carrying 2 suitcases each one of us The room was clearly in a different building without a lift The walls were paper thin and we could hear those next door talking not to mention shutting their door I ll never come back , Location,4.2
07/04/2017, Cyprus , We have stayed in many Central London hotels and this was the worst value ever For 220 per night we had a superior room with a shower room so small the wash basin was in the bedroom The mini kitchen only had a microwave and china over what any decent hotel room has The room was small and the double bed even smaller Though clean there were holes in the sheets The heating cooling fan was so loud you could not sleep with it on Best of all you could clearly hear conversations in the neighbouring room and when other rooms ran water it was like an express train rushing through the room I could go on but you get the idea , Difficult to find anything good to say Only consider this place if it s location is vital you have a double to yourself and do not mind awful value The staff were fine but clearly had no control over the very poor hotel fabric room quality nor were they able to respond to complaints about these ,4.6
6/29/2017, United Kingdom , The staff were rude The rooms are dull and dingy No fresh air in the rooms and it was really humid and hot so had to sleep with AC on and woke with sore throat Have stayed in club quarters Lincolns inn and the staff are amazing and the place is like a palace compared to this dump Shower was dirty I do have pictures but don t have time to post right now ,No Positive,3.3
06/11/2017, Netherlands , Just about everything The Airco was noisy and ineffective My sleep was disturbed by clonking pipes The shower water when tuned to full heat was not even lukewarm The staff refused to give me a invoice since i wasn t the person who paid for the room and called me rude when I insisted , I could check in late in the evening ,4.2
1/21/2017, Switzerland , Very old hotel totally overrated and overpriced They provided us with a wrong room type with very old shower with strange and unusual bath setup when we complained and asked for a change at the beginning they did not want to help and said all the rooms are the same But later we realized that the room is specially designed for handicapped guests When we insisted they changed the room Generally things do not look like a 4 star hotel but mostly looked like a 2 star guest house don t get how it is ranked so high The guests were getting stocked in the elevator on the ground floor and receptionists had to come and open the elevator by a metallic tool Happened to me twice and they were so relax and cool like it was their everyday routine All in all never again , the only positive things about this hotel is its nice location and free coffee at lobby ,3.3
01/09/2017, United Kingdom , The bed has completely ruined my back After one use the toilet was blocked The room was grubby and staff on reception were miserable and irritable We only stayed one night thank goodness and it was a soul destroying experience , Can t think of anything other than a good location for the wedding we attended around the corner from St Pauls ,2.5
12/23/2016, Australia , called as error with preapproval not lifting Staff have not responded as promised and a week later the preapproval is still on credit card People staying should get written confirmation that preapproval lifted when checking out ,No Positive,4.2
12/20/2016, United Kingdom , Heating got stuck on 32 during the night 2am Phoned down to reception only to be told we could only get it turned off not down if they sent someone from maintenance We finally got to sleep at 3am only to be woken by a truck delivering the clean linen to the hotel No bath only a shower with only one flannel and one hand bath towel , The location St Pauls is beautiful if a little loud at night but being that close what can you expect ,4.6
8/26/2016, United Kingdom , False advertising about parking there is no onsite parking is located at least a ten minute walk from hotel staff are very vague about parking location , thank you for sending me a comments email I have just arrived back to Scotland yesterday and have been meaning to write to you and booking com regarding my stay with you on the 23rd of August When i initially booked this room i had searched on the booking com website for hotels with parking and yours was one of many that came up Now as i had a lot of baggage i was expecting onsite parking so i can check in immediately when i arrived outside the hotel i called to ask reception where i was to park the car as i thought it was to the rear of the building I was directed to a private car park 0 3 miles away from the hotel The hotel wasn t even aware of the postcode for navigation Regardless i went parked and had the sluggish walk back to the hotel at reception i met with an abrupt member of staff was checked in within seconds and almost thrown a card at me for my room The hotel room was dated didn t feel clean and worst of all had a damp towel in the bathroom Its was extremely warm there was no fridge and no iron press I travel a lot through my work and i must say this was by far the worst experience ever I look forward to your early response ,3.3
5/26/2016, United Kingdom , I originally booked for four nights and was asked to upgrade to a suite for an extra 30 a night I had to leave after two nights and was charged the full amount for four nights including the suite upgrade Complete rip off Plus the suite had a tiny bathroom and the air conditioning did not work I won t be staying here again nor using booking com ever again, Broadband was quite good,4.2
05/12/2016, United Kingdom , Refurbish all of the bedrooms and corridors Install air conditioning as the rooms were ridiculously hot Be upfront about the ridiculous charging and lack of cancellation policy , The staff were very nice and friendly but the Hotel rooms were so dated and the price so over inflated for such a poor Hotel that it left a bad taste in the mouth ,4.2
04/11/2016, United Kingdom , The receptionist was very rude and abrupt The Room was a disable room with a horrible shower and rust around the bottom of the chair in the bathroom etc the bathroom was very dirty , The bed was comfy and the location was very good ,4.2

12/23/2015, United Kingdom , The rooms were very small for a superior room There was no bath and the room was old and tired and needs a desperate refurb Also the walls were paper thin and every draw and wardrobe door our neighbour opened was horrendously disturbing for us and a lie in was impossible We came back from our four day stay absolutely exhausted The sofa bed was dangerous with sharp edges and was extremely uncomfortable , Free water fruit nuts and complimentary guest facilities room with a vending machine There are lots of places to eat so no need to book b b,4.6

11/01/2015, United Kingdom , Upon arrival you will be asked to pre authorise your credit card with an extra amount on top for alleged expenses that you might incur even though there is no minibar in the room This is a nonsense as the hotel has your credit card details and is protected in any event If you do not agree they will not register the check in Reception staff were in don t care it s just my job mode This is a surprising policy for a supposedly higher level hotel It is far from a welcome to treat the guests as if they are potentially bad debtors In the interior it is a throwback to how offices looked in London in the 1980s The bed although described as a King Size bed was too narrow for two persons Sound insulation is non existent so you will have plenty of chance to hear lovers making love lovers making war children crying and the cleaning ladies cleaning Aircon is a noisy ancient system that continues for 40 minutes after you switch it off but you will need it to stave off the chilblains There was a table stand only on one side of the bed Normal practice would be to have one on each side As a final bit of context I have never before given a negative review and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but St Paul s Club Quarters will not get another visit , Good location Efficient cleaning ladies ,3.3
10/07/2015, United Kingdom , Terrible room layout which involved enduring a sink in the hallway and a toilet in the shower or was that a shower in the toilet either way it was dirty tiny and horrible The bed was very small yet when I got out of bed I hit my knees on the wall and this was an expensive Suite really How does this place get four stars Even in Manhattan it would only get two In a word Terrible , The location The staff tried hard in poor conditions ,4.6
9/22/2015, United Kingdom , We were 3 in the bedroom and my daughter had to sleep on a convertible sofa This means there was no space left in the room The bathroom is very small for this type of hotel and could have certainly be cleaner We did not take the breakfast there as the price was much too expensive , Location is very nice very close to a large number of pubs of all types from classical to more modern Free coffee and tea machine ,4.6

3/19/2016, United Kingdom , I made a genuine mistake when booking this hotel and accidentally booked it for a day earlier than required Arrived in Paris phoned the hotel who were extremely unhelpful and despite having available rooms for the night I needed and having taken the not so cheap room rate for the no show the night before they would not allow me to stay without repaying Apparently there is no such thing as customer goodwill anymore It might be a nice enough hotel but it s not cheap and in my experience the staff were rude and unhelpful Shame because I was really looking forward to staying there , I wouldn t know I didn t get the chance to stay there ,4.2

11/30/2015, Netherlands , We made our booking last minute on booking com When we arrived at the hotel they assigned us a room in the back of the building in the basement It didn t look anything like the pictures shown on the website That it was small was no problem for us we are familiar with the size of London hotel rooms however the dirt we didn t expect The window was blocked by a vacuum cleaner on the outside There was no fresh air in the room On top of the radiator which the bed was pushed against and was about 5 cm away from the pillows there was a thick layer of dust it obviously hadn t been cleaned in ages When we came up to reception to complain the staff was very rude and would not help us at all unless we paid 40 pounds extra for another room type and on top of that we would have to move rooms during our stay This was completely unacceptable to us since the room was dirty We decided we wanted to leave the hotel since the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable by the treatment from the staff The hotel then informed us that they would only refund 50 of our 3 day stay We only were inside the room for 15 minutes We didn t use or touch anything they could easily resell the room to another victim if they wanted to This room is more like a storage space then a hotel room they should be forbidden to sell it at such a price at all Any normal service providing hotel would let their guests leave if they are this unhappy with the room and refund them the entire amount We travel a lot for work and never had such an awful experience in any hotel around the world Besides the room being dirty the staff is very rude and unprofessional they ve never heard of customer service Instead of trying to resolve the situation at one point the lady at reception told us you are so stupid and stop talking and walked away to the other room ,No Positive,2.5

6/20/2017, United Kingdom , The air con did not go below 26 which on a hot day is a nightmare someone said they would look at it but never showed up we saw them giving out fans but they apparently ran our The door which opened to the outside would not lock there was a barrier outside and a small chain inside but anyone could have climbed over and bashed the door open The car park was full so they sent us to one down the road which you could exit on foot right near the hotel but when you had to return to it with your bags you couldn t get back through those doors so you had to walk down the road and then basically all the way back on yourself to the hotel side underground It was narrow and difficult to manoeuvre in a big car and they still charge 16 not 12 like it says on some sites for the privilege Don t stay here if you want to be close to city centre either a long bus ride to the nearest tube stop or ferry ride over to Canary Wharf with a walk to the tube We had a drink in the bar only to find inflated prices and a discretionary 12 5 service charge we went to the bar for our drinks but would have paid the same if we d just sat down and got someone to serve us We found a dirty coffee cup next to our bed though I have to say generally the room was clean and tidy small but fit for purpose I personally wouldn t stay here again mainly because I didn t find it very convenient for getting to or getting around , The outside restaurant bar area is nice to look over the water towards Canary Wharf The communal areas grounds are well looked after and very welcoming Staff are very friendly even if they do forget to come and see you when promised ,4.6
6/19/2017, United Kingdom , The room was not at all as depicted by the images it looked wonderful on the pictures river view wide ground to ceiling French doors balcony open and airy reality was a cell with a port hole that would not stay open unless propped with a pen the night was for my husbands birthday linked to seeing Guns and Roses and so was a treat room service Did not answer on three occasions we rang reception who said they would pass on our message and room service would revert to us this did not happen the price of overnight parking was charged at 16 but on booking com stated 12 this was reviewed and Amended I was upset and embarrassed that the special occasion was ruined by poor description of room as I would not have booked if it had been described as it truly was and other services on offer were not actually provided the trip had been planned for six months and turned out not to be the perfect Experience that I had wished for my husband I felt let down by false advertising, Cleanliness,4.2

08/10/2016, United Kingdom , Terrible parking which we were charged twice for then had to carry our cases up two flights of stairs to reception Long queues for checking in checking out breakfast Rude hotel staff housekeeping supervisor barged in our room whithout knocking telling us we shouldn t be in the room then after nearly an hour of waiting not knowing what was going on we were told we could stay in the room Paid extra for a bigger room with balcony and river city view but the room still felt cramped and the bathroom was tiny the door hit the loo when you opened it and there was barely a square foot to stand in the whole bathroom As for the balcony with view the river city could only be seen if you stood right at the edge of the balcony and stretched your neck right over and round Poor quality breakfast bacon was more fat than meat and the rest was tasteless When I tried to complain whilst checking out I was shot down and ushered off as quickly as possible Real let down expected a lot more from this hotel , Good location free ferry over to Canary Wharf for hotel guests,4.6
08/10/2016, Germany , Oh dear We arrived early during the day and from the way we were received and welcomed I thought this was going to be an amazing stay Unfortunately I would be sorely disappointed The service I received from the night staff was the worst I have ever seen and received and for the last 18 months I spent at the very least 5 to 10 days a month in a hotel I thought I seen it all First night having requested before my arrival foam bedding through Hilton Honors my wife s allergic feather down as silver status member I am apparently entitled to this but alas I didn t find any I tried to call and left the phone on speaker for a good 15 minutes before I hung up I tried another number that they made available apparently this number was supposed to make your stay better and no answer again Then I had to trek five floors down through a maze of rooms on the ground floor you have to see how poor the floor layout is to appreciate the strain and when I finally got to reception guy told me they never answer their phones on weekends because the phones are serviced He also told me it would be impossible to get any foam bedding because he could not leave the front desk because pointing at the queues of people behind me I returned my wife removed all the bedding and we were prepared to sleep on a naked bed when bless his soul he managed to give us one paltry foam pillow The next day when I went downstairs and reported the lack of foam bedding Maria was amazing she apologised for the inconveniences and assured that the matter would be resolved without any hassle and she kept her promise I thought ok perhaps dude from the night before had a bad day hey I worked in customer services for many years in many ways as a government official I still do so I know you cant always have your A game on when it comes to customers I forgave him and Doubletree , The day staff the location were great ,4.2

07/02/2017, United Kingdom , Room far from clean air conditioning was a fan full of dust fire alarm flashed bright green lighting up the whole room in the night got there to discover no lift and no other staff member to help take the bags as my partner is awaiting surgery had to struggle between us Staff serving food in flip flops and leggings most certainly not 4 stars I would say 3 and pushing it , The location was perfect for sight seeing breakfast was fine,2.5
07/01/2017, United Kingdom , Room allocated next to breakfast room so noise and smells from just after 4am No ventilation as window didn t open , Not much really it was in ok position but nothing much more than that ,3.8
6/29/2017, Ireland , 1 I requested a ground floor or first floor room due to mobility problems When we arrived we were told our room was on the third floor There is no lift We were then offered a room in the basement which was small the bed was small the wardrobe was small the bathroom was in a closet 2 The following morning we went for breakfast at approx 9 15am We were told without apology that breakfast finished at 9 00am It was not possible to get coffee juice toast we were told to make coffee in our room 3 My husband fell out of the bed during the night He is used to a normal sized double bed 4 Staff did not care This was supposed to be a 4 star hotel and I would rate it as a 2 star We will certainly not stay there again , There was nothing to like other than the location We previously stayed at an adjacent hotel so we knew the area well ,3.8
6/27/2017, Bulgaria , the room first night the room was horrible they gave us room that is not the same from the site It was downstairs there is no air conditioning no wardrobe as described on the site The room was too small and short We could not sleep because of the heat and there was only one small window which is not enough In the morning they changed the room again not from the picture I could not recommended , location,4.2
6/27/2017, United Kingdom , The building facade gave a complete misrepresentation of the property inside Three floors with narrow staircase and no lift What staff there were not overly helpful and showed little enthusiasm The breakfast room was minute and basically in the cellar with poor ventilation The kitchen was a small room in the cellar and the smell of the cooking was transposed throughout the building the juice fruit and milk containers we re placed tightly together on top of a cupboard along with coffee warming machine The breakfast was not attractive and everything was swimming in grease The bedroom on the third floor was in need of a good spring clean the nets were filthy the floor sloped from one corner to the opposite wall Overall not worthy of 2 stars at the most definitely not 4 star as advertised, The location was the only positive part of the hotel ,3.3
6/25/2017, United Kingdom , The price was too much for the standard of the hotel The bed was very hard and uncomfortable Breakfast was ok bacon was like rubber overall not impressed, The location to the theatre,4.2
6/25/2017, Italy , Very dusty small and cramped single room Overpriced by any western standards I understand that people will always book a room in Bloomsbury for what APPEARS to be a low price compared with the service but at least try to invest on the atmosphere The name and the photos of the ad are really misleading I can only suggest this place as an extreme emergency situation but I really believe even a youth hostel would be more charming and equipped , General niceness of stuff although one had the impression these days it s more important to be fluent in Russian than in English at London s hotels lobbies The bathroom was surprisingly ok and clean although small and with very low quality towels ,4.6
6/19/2017, United Kingdom , The room was a little snug I mean my dogs kennel was bigger than this 1 5 meters x 6 meters with the double bed with it s brown stained duvet squeezed in at the end There was no bar so just a B B really, Breakfast was really good,4.2
06/11/2017, Switzerland , Noisy due to the street and bad windows Doors making too much noise when closing My room was too tiny even nothing for putting my clothes It was cold and I did not manage to set the heater or it was simply not working The bed sheet at one day was dirty At breakfast the coffee was quite bad and never ready at 7 30 , The shower was very good,4.5
06/09/2017, United Kingdom , Traffic ruined my sleep That us the number one necessity of booking a hotel room The hotel staff knew that the window is not double glazed and yet I was put into the room The breakfast was like a factory production line I shall not book the hotel again , I like some of the staff who did their best ,3.3
06/09/2017, United Kingdom , Do not under any circumstances book the small single room this is room G2 This is literally a store cupboard with a short bed crammed into the corner and a tiny wet cell for a bathroom I m not the tallest person 5 5 165cm but the bed in this room was far too short even for me I also had to move it away from the wall a little bit as this is an outside wall mostly of the wall is a drafty window actually and as a result absolutely freezing Even with the bed nudged away from the wall I still woke up with a raging headache as there was a draft from the window all night and any part of me that was not covered by the duvet was cold and damp This house would also do well with stocking up on WD 40 The door hinges creak squeak and whine rather loudly Something that being in room G2 you will not be able to avoid witnessing The room is adjacent to the door leading to the breakfast room and for some reason someone kept going in and out of it until 2 30am and then again from around 6 30am onwards It doesn t take a genius to work out how much sleep I actually got With the room also being under the stairs definitely not in a cute way like in Harry Potter and just opposite the hotel entrance you will hear all the comings and goings no matter how quiet the minority of people try to be If it s not their footsteps or voices waking keeping you up it will be the squeaky doors As for the bathroom I was amazed at the outstanding water pressure of the hand held shower head Unfortunately the physical size of the actual shower can t quite cope with the masses of water shooting out of the shower head so you will be flooding the bathroom even if you re conscious of it and try had to avoid it Consequently you ll be flooding the bedroom too so make sure to move everything off the little floor space there is around the bed before you attempt to shower , The location of this hotel is relatively convenient if you re just looking for somewhere to put your head for a few hours after a night out Make sure to either take earplugs or get blind drunk before turning in though ,4.2
06/09/2017, Switzerland , The bed bugs in my room and the absence of reaction from the hotel management The noise from the streets , The place was conveniently close to our professional meeting location The hotel staff is friendly ,3.8

4/15/2017, United Kingdom , We were in a room near the breakfast room Staff were speaking so loud at 6 30 in the morning that it woke us up Also the noise of guests and crockery was loud so we didn t get much sleep This room should not be used as a bedroom as it s far too close to the dining area Altogether very disappointed with our stay and bad value for money , The location,4.2
04/09/2017, United Kingdom , They put us in basement room next to kitchen and dining room Very noisy Also started decorating whilst we were there didn t tell us got paint on my jacket I complained 3 times and the manager was never available always in a meeting , Near to places we wanted to visit,4.2

3/18/2017, United Kingdom , Was put in an underground room like a prison Window overlooks the laundry Only one electricity socket next to the door so use an ironing board you have to stands stuck to the door No curtain on the window A man arrived an hour after I checked in 2pm to fix the curtain when I wanted to have some me rest,No Positive,4.2
3/13/2017, United Kingdom , Bed was broken Mattress severely sloped to one side v bad nights sleep Offered 15 discount on next stay Not enough to compensate for the pain it caused the next day V small breakfast room and so was breakfast , Relatively close to walk into central London Staff were friendly Room was quite spacious and clean ,4.6
03/04/2017, United Kingdom , We waited a good 5 mins at reception with no one there despite ringing the bell 3 times My room G2 was a cabin I could touch the walls with my arms outstretched I m just under 6 foot tall My feet were hanging off the bottom of the bed my head almost touched the shower head The view outside was of some old sofas and an aluminium ladder dumped outside It was right next to the extractor fans so I was woken by those starting at 0700hrs and then everyone having to walk past my door to get downstairs to the breakfast room I know the rate is only 75 night but these days that can get you a decent Premier Inn Not impressed , Breakfast was nice but cramped and busy ,4.2
2/17/2017, United Kingdom , Multiple issues two examples 1 The lock on the door did not work so I had to push the bed up against the door in the night whilst I slept on it to make sure no one came in 2 On the Saturday afternoon I was there I came back in the middle of the day to be told I was not allowed in my room because members of staff were moving 3 large pieces of furniture through my room out into the garden my room had a door into the garden without gaining permission asking me if it was OK or even telling me this was going to happen When I asked if they could stop and carry out the moving of the furniture on Sunday morning after I had vacated the room because I was in a rush they refused and said they would only be a few more minutes another 15 minutes past They left my room full of dirty foot prints on the floor and had moved many of my personal items to get out of the other door , Sadly not one aspect of the hotel was even up to a satisfactory standard ,2.9
2/14/2017, United Kingdom , Bed bugs having to leave the hotel at 4am in the morning on the first night and walk to a sister hotel with mice and being charged for the horrific experience no sleep , The lady on reception tried to help but ultimately she was limited in her scope as her boss was sleeping ,2.5
2/13/2017, Belarus , The room was extremely small It was cold in the room as well The door in the room did not work very well Some members of staff were unwelcoming talking foreign language in front of me Others were very helpful Breakfast starts not until 7 30 which I can t comment on as I was unable to attend , Location is excellent proximity to train station restaurants and bars Price ,4.2
02/10/2017, Malta , First of all it is not a hotel of more than 2 people in a room Why I was travelling with my family mum and dad and we took the family room My bed was a sofa bed half broken and a very thin mattres on it which its not even suitable for camping When we told the receptionist she told us do not worry You just sleep and you will go out and also when i need it cups for coffee she said this is not my job and she gave us like by force also note that this hotel does not have elevator sobif you have heavy laguages it will be difficult for you to get up the stairs Our room was downstairs so we could listen screaming and footsteps all the time walking i do not recommend it sorry , The wifi and the shower is the only thing we found fair ,2.5

01/02/2017, United Kingdom , My small single was not as described and paid for it was a cold blocked off back passage with locked half covered external back door with no key or bolt I was afraid someone could unlock the door from the outside The bed was a child s bed with no headboard jammed up against the door There was a small side table no chair desk wardrobe luggage rack iron board hairdryer in fact at 5 4 I could touch both sides of the room simultaneously and only just fitted in the bed Luckily I only had a small cabin sized wheelie case and handbag because it would not have been possible to bring a large case in to the room Thank goodness I was slim enough to slip in to the tiny ensuite also Unfortunately the room was in need of repair and redecoration too The male receptionist was quite unsympathetic and had no idea why I was not happy with the room The hotel was full so I could not be allocated another room room booked weeks prior At 11pm at night he suggested I could go and try and find another hotel He didn t offer to help me and of course I would have had to pay for this corridor Overall terrible experience never to be repeated You have been warned , The female night receptionist was sympathetic The breakfast was fresh and plentiful,4.6
12/19/2016, Germany , The room was clearly not a room it was a lobby to the garden where they put a bed 80x170cm which obviously was a sofa and not a bed Located on one of the landing in the staircase the room was noisy and not comfy at all the bathroom was a cupboard where I could barely stand I travel a lot for business and that room was far way the worst I ve ever had ,No Positive,4.2
12/13/2016, United Kingdom , It was very old fashioned with brown carpets and everywhere needed to be painted the net curtains in the bedroom looked dirty for the price I paid and the number of stars I was expecting a lot better The rooms were very small and the bathrooms were tiny Breakfast tasted good but the dining room wasn t great not much room and very dark , The location was great with only a couple of minutes walk to the tube and on the Euston line very easy to get to,4.2
11/29/2016, United Kingdom , I was in a bottom floor single room and it was more like old and run down back utility room which had a door and a full room length large widow to the back Also there was no headboard well unless you include the back door as one As a result this room was freezing I can t understate how bad his room was and can t believe that they are using it as a room I only stayed approx 2 hours as it was so uncortable and cold they had no other rooms available but did allow me to checkout without any charge found another hotel around the corner , The staff member was helpful in contacting manager about the issues I had but apart from that nothing,2.5
11/27/2016, Zimbabwe , everything was so disgusting that i d go for expedia next time , how can you possibly sell out a hotel like that as a 4 star please go see for yourselves or read the reviews at trip advisor tiny rooms no wardrobes no fridge dirty noisy cooking smell unprofessional staff 2 star would be right for it ,3.3
11/27/2016, United Kingdom , The room allocated to me on the ground floor was previously a hallway The converted room was so small with a locked glass door to the garden The adjacent shower room was extremely tight There was a floor grip where attempts had been made to stick it down ehich in my view was a trip hazard The receptionist did not tell me breakfast isn t served after 9 00 Therefore I missed it Staff were not particularly concerned This had been sold by booking com as 4 , Location central to where I wanted to be,4

10/12/2016, Jersey , This must be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in London I have stayed in a lot and I am at a loss why it is rated how it is Our room and particularly en suite was very dirty and grimy In addition the smell of grease and fried food permeates through the whole hotel every morning leaving your clothes in need of a dry clean We couldn t even open our window due to the smell coming up from the basement kitchen Don t let the photos on this website fool you as I did , Nothing,2.5

08/05/2016, United Kingdom , The booking confirmation showed that room had air conditioning and a laptop safe safe deposit box It had neither unless you count a pedestal fan that sounds like an apache taking off as air conditioning and the safe was present but had no power looked like it had been broken into and was not affixed to anything All this was compounded by it being the hottest day of the year and the room displaying a sign that we leave our possession in the room at our own risk The cleanliness and quality of the rooms is nothing like the pictures The staircases are a hazard as individual steps are sinking and have not been repaired The beds are not remotely comfortable there are no satellite channels available on the TV as advertised and the cooked breakfast was disgusting grease fest stick to the cereal I only booked the place to be near Euston station but I ve rated location here based entirely on a tourism perspective There is nothing noteworthy nearby if you don t need to be in this area don t be , Nothing really The staff were polite nothing out of the ordinary but saying that being polite and apologetic didn t get me a room with air conditioning ,2.9

7/15/2016, Canada , The room was so small it was claustrophobic The bathroom was barely big enough to fit in There was no air conditioning and the room was stiflingly hot It was on the street side so without air the window was open and it was noisy Really think how badly you want to stay here before booking English Breakfast wasn t what you d expect from a pub or anywhere else and was missing traditional elements , Location was great and really close to the underground ,4.2
6/29/2016, United Kingdom , We were positioned in LG1 lower ground where people could see through the window should the curtains be open and we were lying in bed not a big problem BUT the main air con wasn t working and it seemed we had a standing air con unit next to the bed this air con unit generated more heat from the side than the cool air it could produce making the room a sauna we could open the window but have to keep the thick curtains closed for any sort or privacy meaning no cold air would pass through we were up several times in the night for cold showers SLEEPLESS NIGHT,No Positive,4.2
6/15/2016, United Kingdom , 1 room very small if your bmi is greater than 20 you will struggle Walls cracked For 100 a night not great sorry i don t like writing this review Honestly the room was just the bed and a foot of space to the left Bathroom v small sink very small 2 poor selection at breakfast on buffet but cooked breakfast ok 3 some hotel staff very rude although to be fair 2 good, location Some staff tried to help Shower good,4.2
5/31/2016, United Kingdom , The room was so small I couldn t even put my clithes on properly it was part of the landing that got sectioned off and made into a room This was not fairly reflected in the booking process and the price was xomparable to other places I have stayed in where the room size was much better Breakfast was served in the basement with very little ventilation which made the breakfast hall unbearable to sit in No wi fi in rooms either which is atrocious , The location is handy for central London and close to underground stations ,4.6
5/17/2016, United Kingdom , The windows were filthy on the INSIDE see photo Could not open the window would have got covered in dirt while trying in any case and the room was too hot Asked them to open it when I went out but they didn t Curtain falling off rail so privacy poor Could hardly hear the tv at times due to traffic noise in a VERY small room tv at foot of the bed Nowhere to put case no room for a chair or table hardly room to stand up beside bed and get dressed Dining room too small so had to queue ages for breakfast Toast was not toasted just died up bread Their philosophy is Pack em in tight and charge a lot of money because we re in a good spot , Only good thing really is location ,3.8
5/15/2016, Sweden , How this hotel has 4 stars is completely outrageous It is hugely expensive to what you get I had booked a small single room and it was truly small Beside the small 80 cm single bed there was less than 80 cm floor space width The bathroom was actually no more than 60x120cm and had I not been a quite petite individual I would literally not been able to get into or turn in the tiny shower Good water pressure though ,No Positive,4.2
5/14/2016, United Kingdom , Micro size room sleepless due to road noise poor room facilities no air cooling system Shower handles jammed not for disabled no sound proofing on walls or windows Window shutter jammed Poor blinds on window No space for suitcase No wardrobe for clothes , Staff,4.6
5/14/2016, Greece , The room LG1 was a basement room below street level next to the Hotel ventilation which was noisy at night Not worth paying 140 Euros per night for such an accomodation ,No Positive,4.6
05/12/2016, United Kingdom , I knew it was a small room but it was really no more than a cupboard I am only 1 63m and I could just about touch both sides of the room Also I could hardly turn around in the shower It was also far too hot and even with a fan provided by reception I had a poor nights sleep , Staff on reception very friendly,4.6
4/28/2016, United Kingdom , The entrance smelt of smoke The reception was unmanned rundown messy and dirty Reception staff seemed like they had better things to do than speak to me The walls and windows were rundown and a bit grubby net curtains were grubby bathroom door was grubby house keeping was so poor that the previous guest had left some shoes in the bottom of the wardrobe and house keeping hadn t seen them No ironing facilities or hairdryer in room had to ask for them and this seemed to be an inconvenience to them The outside of the hotel was dirty and rundown Bathroom was TINY like 1 5ft by 2 5ft if that If I had been staying more than one night or had been there for anything more than work I d have checked out before I checked in First impressions count for a lot and my first and last were as bad as each other , The bed was comfy although I do prefer a firmer mattress so some guests may not like this They accommodated my request for an early check in Fire place in the room was a nice touch although purely decorative Room was warm Refilled coffee tray on request Bedding was clean and fresh Breakfast was basic but not terrible,3.3
4/25/2016, United Kingdom , The room was very hot when I arrived The sash window and the inner sash were both stuck open so the air conditioning was ineffective The inside of the windows and the frames were absolutely filthy resulting in black handmarks on the walls where other people had obviously tried to move the windows I asked the receptionist to arrange for the window to be closed only to be told it already was I assured her it wasn t and someone did come and close it while I was out However they did not manage to close the inner sash so as a result it was very noisy with traffic and sirens throughout the night Made for a poor nights sleep ,No Positive,4.6
4/24/2016, United Kingdom , Smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in had to move my bag around to move in the room Feet touched the wall in the bed Iron smoked when I turned it on Reception smelled of overpowering cleanly products Really noisy as the exterior window had been nailed open and there was just a single pane of extra glazing Uncomfortably hot Very pleased to leave in the morning ,No Positive,3.3
4/24/2016, United Kingdom , Rooms were incredibly small and beds for anyone over 5 8 foot was a problem Also I booked for two people and they charged my account even though I stated the two people were paying on departure ,No Positive,4.6
4/23/2016, United Kingdom , Staff try their best in poor English No management visible or contactable , The room was a tiny cupboard on the cellar Very claustrophobic The sink so tiny the kettle didn t fit under the tap The front desk is not manned until about 1pm and they don t allow you to check in until 2pm even though the room cupboard under the stairs was free not at all value for money,2.9
4/20/2016, United Kingdom , Small and crammed area for breakfast Staff unable to understand what your menu choice was required for breakfast Insufficient room in bedroom , It served its purpose for our needs,4.2

04/12/2016, United Kingdom , Had issues with the checking in Took over an hour to resolve with bloomsbury denying my reservation despite me having email proof from Booking Com and then asking to just purchase another room to deal with it in the morning as this was getting very late into the night with work the next morning Seemed very reserved to assist and then Booking com finally answered the phone to refuse any form of compensation Booking Com blaming the Bloomsbury palace and the Bloomsbury palace blaming Booking com Overall did not feel like a guest in the hotel and more a nuisance ,No Positive,4.6
04/07/2016, United Kingdom , The room 105 was ludicrously small The wall was cold and given how small the room was I woke up every time I turned in bed The breakfast was mediocre poached eggs hard white sliced bread , ,3.8

3/14/2016, United Kingdom , Ridiculously small single room containing shabby furniture dirty glassware and a tiny rock hard bed Clearly no thought at all given to comfort of guests ,No Positive,3.8
03/10/2016, Italy , I really can t believe this hotel is classified as 4 stars a part from the price Rooms are so small that you can t open your luggage no wardrobe and you don t have enough air for breathing New windows have been placed over the old ones and in order to open them you have to jump on the bed when I tried to open it to have more air it suddenly fell down and I could have seriously hurt my hands and fingers It was really dangerous , position,3.3
02/11/2016, Spain , The room was to small entering wind through all the windows The bed to small and I only am 1 73cm, The location is very good Personal is very friendly,4.6
02/04/2016, United Kingdom , I definitely would not recommend staying here We arrived in the morning to leave our suitcases and couldn t check in yet which was fine However there was no secure space available to leave our luggage it was just left next to the reception desk all day When we came back later to check in we were given room G03 on the ground floor It was the worst room I have ever seen The room was right next to the hotel entrance so noise was definitely a problem The room was tiny you could only access the bed from one side and the tv was to the right of the bed so it would have been impossible to watch The window opened on to the side walk of Gower Street which has a lot of traffic at all times of day so noise was definitely a problem from that side as well There was a horrible smell in the room it smelled like the bathroom hadn t been cleaned in months We went to the reception to ask for a different room because the one we were given was not inhabitable but all they could offer us was some febreeze to mask the smell We ended up having to find another hotel at 8pm in the evening the night before a big work meeting , There was relatively little argument about refunding our payment straight away ,2.5
01/11/2016, United Kingdom , quality of room not baby friendly despite a phone call prior to booking to say it was carpet rod grippers visible and could be stood on travel cot not real cot again despite a call prior to booking to confirm it wasn t a travel cot reception staff not friendly at all , friendly maintenance man location,4.2
12/11/2015, Turkey , The room was so small that a person my size could not even fit I am a fairly small person and me and my luggage together was too much for this 5sqm small little space including bathroom that shower tho new was tiny and toilet seat was so close to sink that event I could hit my head The bed squezed toward to window was getting so much street noise I though I was gonna get nauseous from street pollution I can not warn you enough Internet photos do not always show reality There are better places for this price I urge Booking dot com to find better places or double check photo reality ratio , Bathroom was renovated and the sheets were clean Thank God Other than that everything about this hotel was wrong ,3.3
12/09/2015, United Kingdom , I had a terrible experience and have since tried several times to contact the manager who has failed on each time to get back in touch with me On my first night i was woken up at 1 45 in the morning by a loud alarm going off outside my room I had to phone reception to inform them to turn it off It came on again later on in the night and completely disrupted my sleep I woke up late and tired and was so upset by the previous nights events I didn t want to eat breakfast so went out to a cafe instead on route to my meeting The following morning i was due to travel back to Devon and was very upset to find no hot water whatsoever in the shower None one in the hotel explained or apologised to me and I later overheard the receptionist say that someone was going to come and fix it later that day I would like a part refund but this hotel isn t responding Please help , The location was great and the female receptionist was very friendly ,3.8
12/07/2015, Poland , Triple room in the underground floor very dark looking like a dungeon the pictures on booking com shows very different above the ground room Due to walls ceiling curvature it was not possible to place mirror on normal height so shaving required bending me back During the day of our stay there was no hot water boiler malfunction and the staff started action to fix it only after my call There was no heating December either and the personnel was very well aware of the issue they were using electric heater at the reception desk but they started acting on the issue only when I directly asked them to do so There were no additional blankets in the whole hotel I don t even mention lack of blankets in the room as there was no cabinet in the room to store them or your belongings There is air conditioning mentioned on booking com in my room I was only able to find old fan it was cold so no big issue For me it looks like the universal recipe for a hotel in London take some old place invest in it once then run it for 20 years without any repairs and call for serious amount of money The word Palace in hotel s name is just a sad joke , Location,4.2
12/06/2015, United Kingdom , Room was minuscule Only just enough space to cram a single bed in Don t use if you have any incling of claustophobia Breakfast was canteen style Far from palacial , Convenient for travel and venue ,4.6

9/13/2015, Germany , This is the right hotel for you if you are prepared to 1 have neither a chair nor a table in your room 2 have no hanger for your towels 3 use a breakfast room with an open kitchen that makes you smell like sausage and bacon for hours 4 have a metal grilled window if you stay in a Lower Ground room with NO ESCAPE should there be a fire in the hallway of stairway 5 NOT be able to open a window 6 NOT have ventilation in the windowless bathroom 7 NOT have anyone guard your baggage after check out they just tell you to leave it next to the reception desk without any need to identify yourself when you come to pick it up later 8 carry your baggage to the third floor no elevator There was no TV remote control in my room and the safe didn t work Fire doors were always left open even though a sign told you to keep them shut My advice Look for another hotel ,No Positive,3.8

12/21/2016, Germany , The whole setting is bad beginning with the point that they do not have a parking space so we had to use the public parking from the mall 40 day The entrance is currently on the 4th floor only to be accessed from inside the mall The whole hotel seems to be under construction and this is influencing the operation in a very bad way I ordered a delux room with kingsize bed I got a very small room with a double bed From 10 00 to 18 00 you hear very loud construction noise so no chance to rest or stay in the room during this time On booking com com was no information about the current situation construction And if you complain at the reception they tell you they can t do anything for you They don t even offered us a drink for free or something simple Even the room service is just from illy brought in a bag do not order , I was really happy to have my girl with me and was finaly able to leave the hotel not as you would expect through the front door as the lobby is under construction ,3.3
11/24/2016, France , Wifi connections work The internet however does not The hotel is under renovation Because of that access to rooms is organised in a very convoluted manner The part of the hotel yet to be renovated looks rather shabby Certainly not worth the price We were asked for our e mail address because it was missing from the file Two days later newsletters and commercial offers from Hyatt started pouring in Ironically the unsolicited messages try to convey the impression that you re given the opportunity to be part of some exclusive club In reality all you get is a small room showing its age at least in that hotel I ve stayed in Paris hotels that were cheaper better equipped and much much closer to the city center , Adequate breakfast ,3.8

6/29/2016, France , Everything else This hotel should not be called a Hyatt it ruins the brand s reputation Everything is extremely old minuscule room old carpets decoration bathroom plugs do not work It even smells bad Very noisy construction work going on from 10 to 6pm I guess they are at least trying to resolve the old age issue They should not sell the rooms right next to the construction work but mine was right under I also found the staff to be mostly rude and not understanding as for some unforeseen reasons I could not make it on my planned night and asked them to modify the reservation to either reimburse or postpone to the day after or a later time within the same month all of these options were refused actually Booking com asked the hotel themselves and were shocked by the lack of professionalism and customer service provided by Hyatt Etoile I ended up paying double the price on another day to stay in a hotel which in my opinion is no better than a 2 stars My original fare was good enough that it would have only been a disappointing trip but the price I ended up paying and the general attitude of the staff I had to deal with makes this hotel a complete joke Booking a Hyatt anywhere in the world is usually a safe bet in terms of facilities as well as general service provided Hyatt Paris Etoile is the exception , The situation of the hotel is very convenient Rooms with Eiffel Tower view probably offer one of the most amazing views of Paris,4.2
